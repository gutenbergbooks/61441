<span class="smaller">A MIDNIGHT VISIT FROM THE LITTLE GREEN GOBLIN</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="165" height="155" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Little Bob Taylor was mad, discouraged, and
thoroughly miserable. Things had gone wrong—as
things have the perverse habit of doing with
mischievous, fun-loving boys of ten—and he was
disgruntled, disgusted. The school year drawing
to a close had been one of dreary drudgery;
at least that was the retrospective view he took of it. And warm,
sunshiny weather had come—the season for outdoor sports and vagrant
rambles—and the end was not yet. Still he was a galley slave
in the gilded barge of modern education; and open and desperate
rebellion was in his heart.</p>

<p>One lesson was not disposed of before another intrusively presented
itself, and tasks at home multiplied with a fecundity rivaling
that of the evils of Pandora’s box. Yes, Bob was all out of sorts.
School was a bore; tasks at home were a botheration, and life was a
frank failure. He knew it; and what he <em>knew</em> he knew.</p>

<p>He had come from school on this particular day in an irritable,
surly mood, to find that the lawn needed mowing, that the flower-beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
needed weeding,—and just when he desired to steal away upon
the wooded hillside back of the house and make buckeye whistles!
He had demurred, grumbled and growled, and his father had rebuked
him. Then
he had complained
of a headache, and
his mother had
given him a pill—a
pill! think of it—and
sent him off to
bed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/drawing1.jpg" width="350" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>So here he was,
tossing upon his own
little bed in his own
little room at the back
of the house. It was
twilight. The window
was open, and the sweet fragrance
of the honeysuckle flowers
floated in to him. Birds
were chirping and twittering as they settled themselves to rest
among the sheltering boughs of the wild cherry tree just without,
and the sounds of laughter and song came from the rooms beneath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
where the other members of the family were making merry. Bob
was hurt, grieved. Was there such a thing as justice in the whole
world? He doubted it! And he wriggled and squirmed from one
side of the bed to the other, kicked the footboard and dug his fists
into the pillows—burning with anger and consuming with self-pity.
At last the gathering storm of his contending emotions culminated
in a downpour of tears, and weeping, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello, Bob! Hello, Bob Taylor!”</p>

<p>Bob popped up in bed, threw off the light coverings and stared
about him. A broad band of moonlight streamed in at the open
window, making the room almost as light as day. Not a sound was
to be heard. The youngster peered into the shadowy corners and
out into the black hallway, straining his ears. The clock down
stairs struck ten deliberate, measured strokes.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard somebody calling me,” the lad muttered;
“I must have been dreaming.”</p>

<p>He dropped back upon his pillows and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob!”</p>

<p>The boy again sprang to a sitting posture, as quick as a jack-in-a-box,
his eyes and mouth wide open. He was startled, a little
frightened.</p>

<p>“Hel—hello yourself!” he quavered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m helloing you,” the voice replied. “I’ve no need to hello
myself; <em>I’m</em> awake.”</p>

<p>Bob looked all around, but could not locate the speaker.</p>

<p>“I’m awake, too,” he muttered; “at least I guess I am.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re awake all right enough now,” the voice said; “but
I nearly yelled a lung loose getting you awake.”</p>

<p>“Well, where are you?” the boy cried.</p>

<p>A hoarse, rasping chuckle was the answer, apparently coming
from the open window. Bob turned his eyes in that direction and
blinked and stared, and blinked again; for there upon the sill, distinctly
visible in the streaming white moonlight, stood the oddest,
most grotesque figure the boy had ever beheld. Was it a dwarfed
and deformed bit of humanity, or a gigantic frog masquerading in
the garb of a man? Bob could not tell; so he ventured the very
natural query:</p>

<p>“What are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m a goblin,” his nocturnal visitor made reply, in a harsh strident,
parrot-like voice.</p>

<p>“A goblin?” Bob questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s a goblin?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” in evident surprise.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, boy—boy! Your education has been sadly amiss.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Bob replied with unction, his school grievances
returning in full force to his mind. “But what is a goblin? Anything
like a gobbler?”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” his visitor exclaimed in a tone of deep disgust. “Anything
like a gobbler! Bob, you ought to be ashamed. Do I look
anything like a turkey?”</p>

<p>“No, you look like a frog,” the boy laughed.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” the goblin croaked.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” snapped the boy.</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried the goblin. “Surely you know what goblins
are. You’ve read of ’em—you’ve seen their pictures in books,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I think I have,” Bob said reflectively, “but I don’t know just
what they are.”</p>

<p>“You know what a man is, don’t you?” the goblin queried.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, what <em>is</em> a man?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” the lad cried sharply.</p>

<p>“What is a man?”</p>

<p>“Why, a man’s a—a—a <em>man</em>,” Bob answered, lamely.</p>

<p>“Good—very good;” the goblin chuckled, interlocking his slim
fingers over his protuberant abdomen and rocking himself to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fro upon his slender legs. “I see your schooling’s done you <em>some</em>
good. Yes, a man’s a man, and a goblin’s a goblin. Understand?
It’s all as clear as muddy water, when you think it over. Hey?”</p>

<p>“You explain things just like my teacher does,” the boy muttered
peevishly.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” the goblin inquired, seating himself upon the
sill and drawing his knees up to his chin.</p>

<p>“Why, when we ask him a question, he asks us one in return;
and when we answer it, he tangles us all up and leaves us that
way.”</p>

<p>“Does he?” the goblin grinned.</p>

<p>“Yes, he does,” sullenly.</p>

<p>“He must be a good teacher.”</p>

<p>“He is good—good for nothing,” snappishly.</p>

<p>The goblin hugged his slim shanks and laughed silently. He
was a diminutive fellow, not more than a foot in height. His head
was large; his body was pursy. A pair of big, waggling ears, a
broad, flat nose, two small, pop eyes and a wide mouth made up his
features. His dress consisted of a brimless, peaked cap, cutaway
coat, long waistcoat, tight fitting trousers and a pair of tiny shoes—all
of a vivid green color. His was indeed an uncouth and queer
figure!</p>

<p>“Say!” Bob cried, suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh?” the goblin ejaculated, throwing back his head and
nimbly scratching his chin with the toe of his shoe.</p>

<p>“What are you called?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I’m called the Little Green Goblin of Goblinville.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Fitz.”</p>

<p>“Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Fitz what?”</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee.”</p>

<p>“Fits you?” laughed Bob. “I guess it does.”</p>

<p>“No!” rasped the goblin. “Not Fitz <em>Hugh</em>; Fitz <em>Mee</em>.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” giggled the boy, “fits you.”</p>

<p>“I know you did; but <em>I</em> didn’t. <em>I</em> said Fitz <em>Mee</em>.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see the difference,” said Bob, with a puzzled shake of
the head.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t!” sneered the goblin.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t!”—bristling pugnaciously.</p>

<p>“Huh!”—contemptuously—“I say my name is Fitz <em>Mee</em>; you
say it is Fitz <em>Hugh</em>; and you can’t see the difference, hey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s what you mean—that your name is Fitz Mee,”
grinned Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course it’s what I mean,” the goblin muttered gratingly;
“it’s what I said; and a goblin always says what he means and means
what he says.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your home?” the boy ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>“In Goblinville,” was the crisp reply.</p>

<p>“Goblinville?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the capital of Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“And where’s that?”</p>

<p>“A long distance east or a long distance west.”</p>

<p>“Well, which?”</p>

<p>“Either or both.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can’t be!” Bob cried.</p>

<p>“It can’t?”</p>

<p>“Why, no.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t it?”</p>

<p>“The place can’t be east and west both—from here.”</p>

<p>“But it can, and it is,” the goblin insisted.</p>

<p>“Is that so?”—in profound wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s on the opposite side of the globe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded, batting his pop eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you doing here?” Bob pursued.</p>

<p>“Talking to you,” grinned the goblin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know that,” the lad grumbled irritably. “But what brought
you here?”</p>

<p>“A balloon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! What did you come here for?”</p>

<p>“For you.”</p>

<p>“For me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you don’t like to live in this country, and I’ve come to take
you to a better one.”</p>

<p>“To Goblinland?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is that a better country than this—for boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“In what way is it better?” Bob demanded, shrewdly. “Tell me
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” the goblin went on to explain, unclasping his hands and
stretching his slender legs full length upon the window-sill, “in
your country a boy isn’t permitted to do what pleases him, but is
compelled to do what pleases others. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” the lad muttered.</p>

<p>“But in our land,” the goblin continued, “a boy isn’t permitted
to do what pleases <em>others</em>, but is compelled to do what pleases <em>himself</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Bob, surprised and pleased. “That’s great.
I’d like to live in Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“Of course you would,” said the goblin, placing a finger alongside
of his flat nose and winking a pop eye. “Your parents and your
teacher don’t know how to treat you—don’t appreciate you; they
don’t understand boys. You’d better come along with me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a notion to,” Bob replied thoughtfully. Then, abruptly:
“But how did you find out about me, that I was dissatisfied with
things here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know everything that’s going on,” the goblin grinned;
“we get wireless telephone messages from all over the world.
Whenever anybody says anything—or thinks anything, even—we
learn of it; and if they’re in trouble some one of us good little goblins
sets off to help them.”</p>

<p>“Why, how good of you!” Bob murmured, in sincere admiration.
“You chaps are a bully lot!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” the goblin giggled; “we’re a good-hearted lot—<em>we</em>
are. Oh, you’ll just love and worship us when you learn all
about us!”</p>

<p>And the little green sprite almost choked with some suppressed
emotion.</p>

<p>“I’m going with you,” the boy said, with sudden decision.
“Will your balloon carry two, though?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can manage that,” said the goblin. “Come here to the
window and take a squint at my aërial vehicle.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/drawing2.jpg" width="350" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Bob crawled to the foot of the bed and peeped out the window.
There hung the goblin’s
balloon, anchored
to the window-sill by
means of a rope and
hook. The bag looked
like a big fat feather bed
and the car resembled a
large Willow clothes-basket.
The boy was surprised,
and not a little disappointed.</p>

<p>“And you came here in that
thing?” he asked, unable to conceal
the contempt he felt for the primitive
and clumsy-looking contraption.</p>

<p>“Of course I did,” Fitz Mee
made answer.</p>

<p>“And how did you get from the
basket to the window here?”</p>

<p>“Slid down the anchor-rope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” Bob gave an understanding nod. “And you’re going to
climb the rope, when you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes; can you climb it?”</p>

<p>“Why, I—I <em>could</em> climb it,” Bob replied, slowly shaking his
head; “but I’m not going to.”</p>

<p>“You’re not?” cried the goblin.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to risk my life in any such a balloon as that. It
looks like an old feather bed.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> a feather bed,” Fitz answered, complacently.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded sagely.</p>

<p>“Whee!” the lad whistled. “You don’t mean what you say, do
you? You mean it’s a bed tick filled with gas, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say,” Fitz Mee replied, positively. “That
balloon bag is a feather bed.”</p>

<p>“But a feather bed won’t float in the air,” Bob objected.</p>

<p>“Won’t it?” leered the goblin.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? Did you ever try one to see?”</p>

<p>“N—o.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, one feather, a downy feather, will fly in the air, and
carry its own weight and a little more, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the lad admitted, wondering what the goblin was driving
at.</p>

<p>“Then won’t thousands of feathers confined in a bag fly higher
and lift more than one feather alone will?”</p>

<p>“No,” positively.</p>

<p>“Tut—tut!” snapped the goblin. “You don’t know anything of
the law of physics, it appears. Won’t a thousand volumes of gas
confined in a bag fly higher and lift more than one volume unconfined
will?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” irritably.</p>

<p>“Well!”—triumphantly,—“don’t the same law apply to feathers?
Say!”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” Bob stammered, puzzled but unconvinced.</p>

<p>“To be sure it does,” the goblin continued, smoothly. “I know;
I’ve tried it. And you can see for yourself that my balloon’s a success.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it wouldn’t carry <em>me</em>,” Bob objected; “I’m too heavy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to shrink you,” Fitz Mee said quietly.</p>

<p>“<em>Shrink</em> me?” drawing back in alarm bordering on consternation.</p>

<p>“Yes; it won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“How—how’re you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>The goblin got upon his feet, took a small bottle from his
waistcoat pocket and deliberately unscrewed the top and shook out
a tiny tablet.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “take that.”</p>

<p>“Uk-uh!” grunted Bob, compressing his lips and shaking his
head. “I don’t like to take pills.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t a pill,” Fitz explained, “it’s a tablet.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the same,” the boy declared obstinately.</p>

<p>“Won’t you take it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t go with me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t?”</p>

<p>The goblin shook his head.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there some other way you can—can shrink me?”</p>

<p>Again Fitz Mee silently shook his head.</p>

<p>“W-e-ll,” Bob said slowly and reluctantly, “I’ll take it. But,
say?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“What’ll it do to me—just make me smaller?”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“How small will it make me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“About my size,” grinned the goblin.</p>

<p>“Oo—h!” ejaculated Bob. “And will it make me as—as <em>ugly</em>
as you are?” in grave concern.</p>

<p>The goblin clapped his hands over his stomach, wriggled this
way and that and laughed till the tears ran down his fat cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh—ho!” he gasped at last. “So you think me ugly, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” the lad admitted candidly, a little nettled.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s funny,” gurgled the goblin; “for that’s what I
think of you. So you see the matter of looks is a matter of taste.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Bob snorted contemptuously. “But will that tablet
change my looks? That’s what <em>I</em> want to know.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t,” was the reassuring reply.</p>

<p>“And will I always be small—like you?”</p>

<p>“Look here!” Fitz Mee croaked hoarsely. “If you’re going
with me, stop asking fool questions and take this tablet.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” Bob muttered, in sheer desperation.</p>

<p>And he snatched the tablet and swallowed it.</p>

<p>Immediately he shrunk to the size of the goblin.</p>

<p>“My!” he cried. “It feels funny to be so little and light.”</p>

<p>He sprang from the bed to the window-sill, and anticly danced
a jig in his night garment.</p>

<p>“Get into your clothes,” the goblin commanded, “and let’s be
off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob nimbly leaped to the floor, tore off his night-robe and
caught up his trousers. Then he paused, a look of comical consternation
upon his apple face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” giggled the goblin.</p>

<p>“Why—why,” the boy gasped, his mouth wide open, “my clothes
are all a mile too big for me!”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee threw himself prone upon his stomach, pummeled
and kicked the window-sill, and laughed uproariously.</p>

<span class="smaller">BOB BECOMES AN AËRONAUT</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-y.jpg" width="175" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“You stop that, you mean old thing!” Bob
blustered angrily.</p>

<p>The goblin laughed the harder.</p>

<p>“Stop it, I say!” the boy shouted, loud
enough to waken all the sleepers about the
house, he thought.</p>

<p>The goblin continued to laugh and rub his fists and kick his
heels.</p>

<p>“Oh, you think you’re smart!” the lad pouted, tears in his eyes,
his lips quivering. “Old Fits! Old Spasms! Old Convulsions!
Yeah! Yeah!”</p>

<p>“Here—here!” cried the goblin, springing to his feet and frowning
darkly. “You mustn’t call me such names, boy.”</p>

<p>“I will!” sturdily.</p>

<p>“If you do, I’ll go away and leave you, just as you are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’re you mad about?”</p>

<p>“You played a mean trick on me, and then laughed at me—that’s
what.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t play any trick on you.”</p>

<p>“You did, too. You coaxed me to take that pill.”</p>

<p>“Tablet, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, tablet. What’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“I persuaded you to take it.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the same.”</p>

<p>“And I forgot you didn’t have your clothes on. Now you’ll
have to put ’em on and take another tablet to shrink them.”</p>

<p>“I won’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t you?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I won’t—that’s why. Think I want to <em>live</em> on pills?
I don’t like ’em.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid to take it?”</p>

<p>“No, I—I’m not. But it wouldn’t shrink my clothes, if I did
take it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will. Look at your night-gown.”</p>

<p>Bob picked up his discarded night-robe and closely examined
it. It was not larger than a doll’s dress. The lad grinned sheepishly,
and began to hustle into his garments. They were a world
too large for him, and hung upon his shrunken limbs in a baggy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
outlandish fashion. His shoes were ten sizes too big; his cap rested
upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Huh!” he muttered in disgust; “I look like a scarecrow.”</p>

<p>“Here!” the goblin said, soberly. “Take another tablet.”</p>

<p>Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, now?” asked Fitz.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to take it,” the boy replied.</p>

<p>“What’re you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will shrink me all away to nothing.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes. These are goblin tablets; gob-tabs we Call ’em for short.
They just shrink a person to goblin size; you can’t shrink any more.
Take it now; it’ll just shrink your clothes.”</p>

<p>“W-e-ll, I—I don’t know; I can’t remain in this fix, though.”
Then in sudden desperation:—“Give it to me; I’ll take it!”</p>

<p>The lad swallowed the tablet. Barely had he done so, when
his clothes shrank to fit him—skin tight.</p>

<p>“Say!” he giggled gleefully, closely examining himself.
“Those tablets are great.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” winked the goblin. “Now are you ready to go?”</p>

<p>“Why—why,” Bob faltered, “I’d like to bid my folks good-bye—especially
mamma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re in nice shape to bid your folks good-bye, now, aren’t
you?” sneered the goblin.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” the boy muttered, sadly shaking his head. “But
I do hate to leave ’em without saying anything about it—especially
mamma.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the goblin grunted, contemptuously. “You tell your
mother of your intention and she won’t let you go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be off; we’re losing too much time.”</p>

<p>“I—I can come back sometime, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw;” snapped the goblin. “I guess you’re satisfied with
things here and don’t want to go at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do want to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on then—and no more fooling. I’ll be a good
comrade to you; we’ll have lots of fun. I’ll call you Bob and you’ll
call me Fitz. Oh, we’ll have a bully time!”</p>

<p>“All right!” the lad cried courageously. “I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” chuckled the goblin.</p>

<p>They leaped upon the window-sill. Fitz Mee caught the anchor
rope and shinned up it, and Bob nimbly followed.</p>

<p>As the lad clambered into the basket he remarked:</p>

<p>“Your balloon’s bigger than I thought it was, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“You’re smaller than you were, that’s all,” the goblin grinned
in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The car was indeed quite roomy and comfortable for such small
beings. A box-shaped bench encircled it on the inside, serving as
seat and locker, and at one side was a small tank of polished metal,
with a pump attachment.</p>

<p>“What’s that thing?” the boy inquired, indicating the shining
tank.</p>

<p>“What thing?” asked Fitz Mee.</p>

<p>“That shiny thing.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s my air-tank and pump.”</p>

<p>“It looks just like the air machine papa has in his office,” Bob
remarked. His father was a physician. “He uses his in treating
people’s throats. What do you use yours for?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” queried the goblin in surprise.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“Well—well! It’s plain you never had anything to do with
feather-bed ballooning. I use it in raising and lowering the balloon.”</p>

<p>“In raising and lowering the balloon?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; that’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“But how do you use it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll show you in a minute,” Fitz Mee answered complacently.
“You know how they raise and lower gas balloons, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I guess so,” the boy replied, a little dubiously. “The
gas raises ’em.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” snapped the goblin, “that’s the lifting power, and
feathers raise feather-bed balloons. But what do they use for ballast
in gas balloons, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sand bags,” Bob answered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the goblin pursued; “and when they want to go higher
they throw out sand, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And when they want to come down what do they do?”</p>

<p>“Let the gas out of the bag,” Bob said at a venture.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” Fitz Mee nodded. “And then they can’t go up
again till they’ve refilled the bag—eh?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the way of it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure it is. Well, we work the thing better with our
feather-bed balloons.”</p>

<p>“We?” Bob cried. “Do all goblins use feather-bed balloons?”</p>

<p>“Of course we do; that’s the way we travel. Didn’t you know
that?”</p>

<p>“No; I never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“My—my!” Fitz Mee laughed. “You have a lot to learn, Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
But I’ll show you how I can bring my balloon to earth or send it to
the skies in a jiffy. When I wish to descend I just pump that tank
full of compressed air. See?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see,” Bob declared.</p>

<p>“You don’t?” muttered the goblin, in surprise and irritation.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, compressed air’s heavier than ordinary air, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, when I get that tank full the balloon’s heavier;
and the increased weight overcomes the buoyancy of the feathers,
and down I come.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”—in open-mouth admiration,—“that’s great! And when
you want to go up again you just let the compressed air out, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” blinked the goblin. “I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>He caught hold of the anchor rope, jerked the hook loose from
the window-sill, and wound up the slender line. Then he flew to the
air apparatus and turned a cock. Immediately there was the hiss
of pent air escaping through a hole in the bottom of the tank, and the
balloon began to ascend—slowly and gently at first, then more
swiftly.</p>

<p>When it was a short distance above the housetop Fitz Mee
closed the cock, remarking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“There! I guess that’ll balance us about right. We’ll rise a few
hundred feet and float there.”</p>

<p>His prediction proved true. When the balloon had cleared the
hilltops, it stopped rising and floated motionless, like a great bubble
with a dripping blob at its pendant point.</p>

<p>“Say!” Bob cried, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the goblin.</p>

<p>“That tank looks just like the one papa has in his office.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> just like it,” the goblin assured him.</p>

<p>“And the car looks just like mamma’s old clothes-basket.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the bag looks just like grandma’s old feather-bed.”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded and winked and smiled.</p>

<p>“Well,” Bob declared triumphantly, “I could take those things
and make me a balloon.”</p>

<p>“Of course you could,” grinned Fitz Mee, “if you were going
to stay at home.”</p>

<p>“And couldn’t I have fun showing off before the other boys!”
Bob chuckled, gloatingly.</p>

<p>“You’ll have lots more fun with me, in Goblinland,” his companion
said quickly.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” the boy murmured reflectively, a little sadly.
Then observing that the balloon had stopped rising:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, what made us stop going up?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” the goblin returned with a half sneer.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” the lad admitted.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” Fitz Mee laughed, “You’re wonderfully dumb, you
are, Roberty-Boberty.”</p>

<p>Bob bristled instantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you call me names,” he cried angrily. “You old—old
Epilepsy!”</p>

<p>“Epilepsy!” the goblin cackled hoarsely, holding his sides and
weaving to and fro. “What does that word mean?”</p>

<p>“Fits,” the boy answered tersely.</p>

<p>“Ho—ho!” the goblin continued to tackle. “You call me
names, but you don’t want me to call you names. Say, Bob?”</p>

<p>Bob made no reply.</p>

<p>“Bob?” Fitz repeated in as pleasant a voice as he could command.</p>

<p>Bob maintained a stubborn silence.</p>

<p>“Bob,” his companion went on, “the reason we stopped rising
is because the weight of the balloon just balances an equal volume
of air at this height. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the lad muttered rather grumpily.</p>

<p>“All right, and if we wished to go higher—”</p>

<p>“We’d have to let out more of the compressed air,” Bob interrupted,
brightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“And if we desired to descend—”</p>

<p>“We’d have to pump more into the tank.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” mumbled the goblin. “You’ll make a great
aëronaut one of these
days.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/drawing3.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then he lifted a lid
of the locker, took out a
small instrument and
busied himself with the
manipulation of its mechanism.
Bob leaned over
the edge of the car and
devoted his attention to
the scene below.</p>

<p>Directly beneath lay
the sleeping village, its
roofs showing white in
the bright moonlight.
To east and west the hills
rolled away, their summits
hoary, their bases
shadowy and obscure;
and among them wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the placid river—a stream of molten silver threading the narrow
vale. The roar of the distant mill-dam sounded sullen and indistinct,
and the mists rising from it waved as fairy plumes and banners.
The lad looked and listened, entranced, enraptured.</p>

<p>“How beautiful it all is!” he murmured feelingly to himself, a
catch in his voice. “I—I like it; and I rather hate to leave it.”</p>

<p>“Homesick already, are you, before you’re out of sight of
home?” Fitz Mee queried, his eyes upon the curious instrument he
had placed in the bottom of the car.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not homesick!” Bob retorted sharply.</p>

<p>“You’re not?” Fitz grinned provokingly. “What did you
mean by your words, then?”</p>

<p>“I was just admiring the beautiful scene, that’s all,” Bob explained.</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated the goblin, wagging his head and saucily extruding
his tongue.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” the lad nodded in return.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll show you scenes far more beautiful—in Goblinland.”</p>

<p>It was Bob’s turn to sneer.</p>

<p>“<em>Maybe</em> you will,” he said.</p>

<p>“I will,” Fitz asserted positively.</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“When we get there, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; when we <em>get</em> there.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get there.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going very fast; we’re still right over the town.”</p>

<p>And the boy laughed aloud, scornfully.</p>

<p>“We haven’t started yet,” the goblin countered.</p>

<p>“No; and we’re not likely to start, as far as I can see—unless a
wind storm comes on; and it may blow us in any direction.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” barked the goblin.</p>

<p>“Bosh, yourself!” snarled the boy.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Let’s quit quarreling.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Shake!”</p>

<p>They solemnly shook hands.</p>

<p>“Now,” the goblin cried briskly, “if you’re ready to say good-bye
to home, we’ll be off.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” the lad answered; “but I don’t see how we’re going
to be off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. See that little instrument on the floor of the
car?”</p>

<p>“That compass?”</p>

<p>“That’s not a compass.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus2">

<p class="caption">A broad band of moonlight streamed in at the open window. (<a href="#Page_11">See page 11.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks like one. What is it?”</p>

<p>“A wireless selector.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that?”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard of wireless telegraph instruments?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you know they send messages with them without using
wires, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, too, you’ve heard or read that there are currents of
electricity running around the globe in all directions, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I—I think I have; yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, the selector picks up or selects any current the operator
desires, and enables him to travel over it in his balloon, using it as a
propelling power.”</p>

<p>“Well—well!” Bob exploded, in frank admiration. “Just like
a trolley car!”</p>

<p>“Yes, except no wire is needed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you tell which way it’ll go, though.”</p>

<p>“The balloon?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’ll go whichever way the needle points.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why will it?”</p>

<p>“Well, the needle of a compass points north, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why does it?”</p>

<p>“Because—because—I don’t know, I guess,” Bob admitted.</p>

<p>“Because the attraction swings it, isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the attraction swings the needle, won’t the needle swing
the attraction?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” the boy stammered; “I never heard of such
a thing!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a poor rule that won’t work both ways?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s what folks say, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is—a mighty poor rule. Now I’ll show you. Watch
me. I desire to travel due east; so I point this little needle in
that direction. That done, I turn this thumb-screw, and off we
start.”</p>

<p>Slowly the balloon began to move toward the east, over the village,
across the river, gradually leaving the valley behind.</p>

<p>“I turn the screw a little more and a little more,” said the goblin,
suiting the action to the words, “and we begin to travel faster
and faster.”</p>

<p>Soon they were going at a rapid and exhilarating speed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
air appeared to whistle past as they cut through it; the moonlit landscape
appeared to flow away behind and beneath them.</p>

<p>“My—my!” Bob cried, gleefully clapping his hands. “I never
expected to travel as fast as this. Fitz, this is simply great.”</p>

<p>“You don’t call this gentle speed going fast, do you, Bob?” Fitz
returned, grinning broadly.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” the boy replied earnestly.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re just loafing along!” the goblin chuckled. “I’ll show
you how I travel when I’m in a hurry to get along. Take off your
cap, or you’ll lose it, and hold on to the car. Now!”</p>

<p>With the last word he gave another turn to the thumb-screw of
the selector. The balloon leaped forward like a mad thing of life;
the fragile car strained and quivered. Bob clutched the seat with
both hands and held on for dear life. The air appeared to rush
past in a cutting, shrieking tempest of wrath, that blinded and deafened
the boy. He tried to scream out, but could not. He felt his
grip upon the seat weakening, and, fearing he might be swept overboard,
he loosened his hold and threw himself to the bottom of the
car. There he lay, panting and gasping—sick with mortal terror.
Then, of a sudden, the mad speed of the balloon began to slacken
and the boy gradually gathered up courage to open his eyes and
look around.</p>

<p>There sat the impish Fitz Mee by the selector, his hand upon
the thumb-screw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello!” the goblin grinned apishly.</p>

<p>“Hello!” the boy muttered in reply.</p>

<p>“How did you like it?” queried the goblin.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like it,” answered the lad.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it fast enough for you?”</p>

<p>“Too fast.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to try it just a little bit faster, eh?”</p>

<p>“No <em>sir</em>!”</p>

<p>“It’s great fun—when you learn to like it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bob grumbled; “and taking pills is great fun—when you
learn to <em>like</em> ’em.”</p>

<p>“I can make the balloon go faster,” Fitz suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll take your word for it,” Bob grinned, shaking his head.</p>

<p>They got up and seated themselves upon the locker.</p>

<p>“Well,” the goblin remarked, yawning, “what do you think of
us goblins as balloonists?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re the candy,” Bob replied, his voice and manner
evincing profound admiration.</p>

<p>“The candy?” snickered his companion. “What do you mean
by that?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re the best ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! Better than you humans, eh?”</p>

<p>“Far better.”</p>

<p>“That so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. And When I come back from Goblinland, I’m going
to get patents on your air-ballast machine and your wireless
selector; and some day I’ll be a mighty rich man—a millionaire.”</p>

<p>The goblin grinned a very broad grin.</p>

<p>“You’re going to take out patents on our inventions, you say,
Bob?” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the boy made reply.</p>

<p>“When you return from Goblinland, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee gulped and screwed his features. Then he began to
chuckle silently, and at last he burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Bob inquired, half in wonder, half in
pique.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s so funny,” croaked the goblin, and he went into another
spasm of rasping, cackling laughter.</p>

<p>“It <em>must</em> be funny,” the boy grunted peevishly. “But what’s so
funny?”</p>

<p>“The thought of your returning from Goblinland, Bob,” Fitz
Mee replied, sobering and wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, can’t I return—if I ever want to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/drawing4.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“You can, I suppose; but I doubt if you ever
will.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’cause.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’cause what?”</p>

<p>“You won’t want to,
after you’ve been there a
day or two.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, eh?”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded and winked seriocomically,
mysteriously. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got to ascend a few thousand feet to clear the tops of
the Alleghany mountains. Let a little more air out of the tank.
There—that’s enough. It’ll be quite cool at the altitude to which
we’ll rise, so we’d better put on the fur coats that are in the locker
under you, Bob, and curl down in the car and snooze awhile.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two were asleep and the feather-bed
balloon was topping the Alleghanies.</p>

<span class="smaller">THROUGH A STORM IN A BALLOON</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="165" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">On awaking Bob was a little confused. But soon
he remembered where he was, and he sat up
and blinked and looked around for his companion.
Fitz Mee stood upon the locker, a
tiny binocular glued to his pop eyes, gazing
intently at the western horizon. It was gray
daylight, and they were making good speed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Fitz?” Bob demanded, alert and interested
at once. “What’re you looking at?”</p>

<p>“Looking at a storm gathering,” the goblin replied, without
turning his head.</p>

<p>The boy rose to his feet, removed his fur coat, and wadded it
into a ball and stuffed it into the locker.</p>

<p>“Storm?” he said. “I don’t see any signs of a storm.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that blue line along the horizon?” Fitz asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Is that the storm?”</p>

<p>“No; that’s the mountains we crossed. But take this glass and
you can see the storm gathering on their tops. See it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“My!” Bob exclaimed, the glass to his eyes. “I guess I <em>do</em> see
it! It’s a black one, too; and it’s moving this way. How soon will
it overtake us?”</p>

<p>This question he asked in some trepidation.</p>

<p>“It won’t overtake us at all, unless we care to have it do so,”
the goblin made answer.</p>

<p>“Why, can we outrun it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“Sure, if we want to.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll want to, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be fun to wait till it’s nearly upon us and then run away
from it, I think. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” Bob returned, dubiously shaking his head,
his gaze still riveted upon the rising storm; “it <em>might</em> not be fun.”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid,” sneered the goblin.</p>

<p>“No, I’m—I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are; you’re a coward.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you call me that!” the lad cried, snatching the binocular
from his eyes and angrily turning upon his Companion.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” the goblin promised. “Now turn your glass toward
the east. What do you see?”</p>

<p>“I see the sea!” Bob cried rapturously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“It’s plain to me as plain can be—</div>
<div class="verse">In fact, I see you see the sea,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">hummed Fitz Mee in sing-song. Then he continued:</p>

<p>“If you’ll take a glance at the ground beneath us,
you’ll notice we’re moving very slowly. I’m loitering—waiting
for the storm to catch up with us; then
we’ll have a race with it, out across the ocean.
In the meantime we’ll have breakfast.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/drawing5.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Breakfast?” Bob questioned. “Where’s
breakfast coming from?”</p>

<p>“From the locker,” smiled the goblin, rubbing
his round little belly and smacking his lips
in anticipatory gusto, “where everything else we
need’ll come from. I always keep my air-ship
stored for a long voyage, for when I leave Goblinland
on business, I never know when I’ll get back home
again. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” was the lad’s expressive but inelegant
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think you need this
morning? You can have whatever you require.”</p>

<p>“What do I think I need?” Bob tittered. “What a question!
I need breakfast, of course, Fitz.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course,” snapped the goblin. “But do you need muscle
food, or nerve food, or fat food, or what?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” stammered the boy, scratching his head in
perplexity. “I never heard of such things, I guess. I know what
I’d <em>like</em>, though; I’d like steak and gravy and hot biscuits, and some
fruit and a glass of milk.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the goblin snorted in supreme contempt. “You’ll find,
Bob, we don’t indulge in such indigestible truck in Goblinland.
Our foods are scientifically prepared, not slapped together haphazard.
We use nothing but the concentrated extracts—the active principals
of food stuffs. I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>He went to the locker and brought forth a small leather hand-case
or satchel.</p>

<p>“Why—why,” Bob muttered, his eyes bulging, “that looks just
like papa’s medicine-case!”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t,” Fitz Mee grunted irritably; “it’s my portable
pantry.”</p>

<p>And he loosened the catch and flung the case open, displaying
several rows of tiny bottles containing tablets and pellets of various
shapes, sizes and colors.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” the boy gagged. “Pills!”</p>

<p>“They’re not pills,” rasped the goblin; “they’re food tablets
and drink pellets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re pills to me, all the same.”</p>

<p>“They’re not pills, I tell you,” Fitz Mee reiterated sharply,
snapping his jaws shut and angrily grating his teeth. “Now I’ll
select what you’re to eat; and you’ll eat it. The storm’s approaching
rapidly; I hear the thunder muttering and see the black clouds rolling.
So you’ll need something to make you strong and courageous.
Here’s a tiger-muscle tablet and a lion-heart tablet. Down ’em.”</p>

<p>Bob shut his mouth and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Down ’em!” the goblin repeated.</p>

<p>“Uk-uh!” the lad grunted.</p>

<p>“You must!”</p>

<p>“I won’t!”</p>

<p>“You’ll starve if you don’t eat.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather starve than take pills.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“I would!”</p>

<p>“It won’t take you but a second to swallow ’em, Bob,” Fitz
Mee said coaxingly. “That’s one of the advantages of our kind of
food; it don’t take long to eat a meal.”</p>

<p>“I never begrudged the time I spent in eating,” Bob remarked,
with rather a sickly grin.</p>

<p>“Well, down the tablets—that’s a good boy.”</p>

<p>“Are those—those things all you’ve got to eat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you have anything else in Goblinland?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” wailed the boy. “I wish I was back home! Nothing
to eat but pills! Golly!”</p>

<p>“There, there, Bob!” the goblin said soothingly, kindly even.
“You don’t wish you were back home; you’re just hungry and nervous.
Take these tablets and you’ll be all right in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>Bob silently held out his hand, his face a picture of lugubrious
woe, and silently took the tablets and swallowed them.</p>

<p>Fitz Mee idly fingered the tiny bottles in the case for a minute
or two, mumbling over the names upon the labels. Then he looked
up and asked:</p>

<p>“Feel better, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the lad admitted rather reluctantly, “I feel stronger and
better, but I’m still awful empty.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not hungry?”</p>

<p>“No; just hollow-like.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’ve been used to filling your stomach with
gross food,” the goblin stated sagely; “you’ll get over that condition
after you’ve lived on tablets and pellets a month or two.”</p>

<p>“A month or two!” the lad groaned. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“You haven’t had anything to drink,” Fitz remarked, smiling
brightly. “Take this pellet.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A water pellet. It contains a pint of water.”</p>

<p>“That teenty-weenty thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it; it can’t.”</p>

<p>“You down it and you’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>Bob took the tiny clear pellet and instantly announced:</p>

<p>“My thirst’s all gone, Fitz, and I feel fuller.”</p>

<p>“But you’re still a little lank—a little empty-like, eh?”</p>

<p>“A little, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll fix you. Take this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop,” the boy demurred. “I’m not going to take all
the pills in that case.”</p>

<p>“This is the last dose I’ll ask you to take,” the goblin returned,
batting his eyes at a bright flash of lightning from the rapidly approaching
storm.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” Bob demanded, dodging the sharp clap of
thunder almost immediately following the lightning.</p>

<p>“A sponge tablet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s it for?”</p>

<p>“It’s to absorb some of the water you’ve taken, and to swell
and fill your stomach.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it—I don’t need it,” Bob said, decidedly shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“All right,” Fitz laughed, “you don’t have to take it. We just
make ’em for folks who aren’t satisfied unless their stomachs are full
all the time. Now I’ll eat my breakfast.”</p>

<p>He hastily selected and swallowed a number of tablets and
pellets; then he closed the leather case with a bang and a snap and
thrust it into the locker.</p>

<p>“Now,” he smiled, “I guess we’re all ready to play tag with that
tempest. And we’ll show it a thing or two—oh, <em>won’t</em> we!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll show us a thing or two,” Bob replied, grinning a
sickly grin and shaking his head dubiously. “It’s getting pretty
close and I don’t like the looks of it. My! Just see those clouds
rolling and whirling! Fitz, I believe it’s a cyclone!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” his companion muttered contemptuously; “it’s
nothing but a summer thunder gust.”</p>

<p>By this time the storm was close upon them, coming swiftly.
The lightning was forking and flashing incessantly; the thunder was
crackling and crashing continuously. Bob gazed at the rolling,
tumbling masses of black clouds, at the play of electricity, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
forest and fruit trees bending before the blast, and shivered; he
listened to the mingled, indescribable uproar of booming thunder and
bellowing wind, and shuddered.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s be off, Fitz!” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” his comrade cried, giving a half turn to the thumb-screw
of the selector.</p>

<p>Before the raging storm they sped, the boy frightened and miserable,
the goblin elated and jubilant. Rapidly they approached
the ocean, and soon they were sailing over a city on the shore. Binocular
in hand, Bob watched the storm behind and the earth beneath,
and trembled. He saw people rushing to shelter; saw fences
and groves leveled, and skyscrapers and steeples sent crashing to
earth.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz—Fitz!” the lad groaned. “It <em>is</em> a cyclone!”</p>

<p>“I guess it is,” the goblin answered nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“And it’s coming closer!” the boy cried in terror. “Let’s go
faster!”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is all right; this is fine sport,” the goblin laughed,
capering about the car and gleefully rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>Out over the ocean they flew—out of sight of land—out over
the boundless expanse of heaving, tossing waters. After them raced
the storm, each minute drawing a little nearer and a little nearer. It
was almost upon them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please, please let’s go faster, Fitz!” Bob screeched, dancing
up and down in an ecstacy of keen affright.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/drawing6.jpg" width="350" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But his shrill cry was whirled away in the tumult of rushing
air that enveloped them, and if the goblin
heard, which is doubtful, he paid no attention
to his companion’s frantic plea.
Then of a sudden the balloon stopped
with a smart jerk and began
to whirl round and
round dizzily. Fitz
Mee’s fat face went white
as paper, and he let out a
cry of alarm and dismay.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Fitz?”
Bob bawled, staggering to his
comrade’s side and shouting in
his ear. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“The lightning has magnetized
the selector!” the goblin
bellowed. “Look at
the needle—pointing
right back toward the
storm! We’re drifting right
back into it! There is nothing now to prevent it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>It was too true!</p>

<p>Immediately they were engulfed—overwhelmed in the maelstrom
of cloud and wind and rain. They could neither see nor hear
for the fury of the elements. The balloon spun round and round
like a top; the light car jerked and swayed and shot this way and
that with lightning-like and awful suddenness. One of the small
ropes supporting it broke and hung dangling from the side. Another
parted and the car sagged dangerously. A frightful lurch
and Fitz Mee was flung upon the locker, the breath knocked out of
him; another lurch, and, with a despairing scream that sounded
above the deafening tumult of the tornado, he rolled overboard and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Bob threw himself into the bottom of the car, his eyes tight
shut, his palms over his ears, and lay there groaning and moaning.
His comrade was gone and he gave himself up for lost. Oh, how he
wished he was safe at home! But in the midst of the tumultuous
storm and his tumultuous thoughts a bright idea suddenly came to
him. He started, he sprang to his feet and was flung flat again.
Then, shaking his head and gritting his chattering teeth, he wriggled
over to the air-tank and turned the cock. The hiss of the escaping
air was music to him. Little by little the buffeted balloon rose, and
soon it floated serenely above the zone of the warring winds and
clouds. Bob was saved!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>A little while he lay upon the floor of the car, looking at the
clear sky overhead and wondering what he was to do. Then he
thought of his lost companion, and murmured feelingly:</p>

<p>“Poor old Fitz! Poor old Spasms!”</p>

<p>As if in answer to his pitying words, he heard a voice calling
faintly but snappishly:</p>

<p>“Bob, you rascal! Don’t you dare to call me Spasms!”</p>

<p>Electrified, the boy sprang to his feet and looked all around.</p>

<p>“Fitz!” he ejaculated. “But where can he be?” Then in
superstitious fear:</p>

<p>“He’s dead; it must be his ghost!”</p>

<p>“Ghost nothing!” came the voice again, a little louder, more
vigorous. “Bob, you’re a fool!”</p>

<p>“Is—is that you, Fitz?” the boy faltered in reply.</p>

<p>“Of course, dunce!”</p>

<p>“Well, where are you?”</p>

<p>“Right down here, dummy!”</p>

<p>Bob flew to the side of the car, hunkered upon the locker and
peered over. There, a few feet down, was Fitz Mee hanging to one
of the broken ropes.</p>

<p>“Why—why, Fitz, what are you doing down there?” Bob asked
foolishly.</p>

<p>“Oh, just enjoying myself; surely you can see that,” the goblin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sneered wrathfully. “But I’ve had enough; I’m no pig. Pull
me up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I can or not,” Bob answered. “But
reach me up your hand; I’ll try.”</p>

<p>After a deal of struggling and kicking and grunting on the
part of both, Fitz was safely aboard.</p>

<p>“I thought I was a goner when I fell over,” he panted; “I
just happened to catch the rope.” Then, with unusual feeling:
“And you saved us both, Bob, by thinking to let out the air. I
couldn’t have hung on, in that storm, a minute longer; and, then the
balloon was fast going to wreck. It was my foolhardiness that caused
all the trouble, and your thoughtfulness that got us out of it. I’ll
never go back on you, Bob, old boy, never! But now the storm’s past,
we must get under way again.”</p>

<p>“Will the selector work?” the boy asked in some anxiety.</p>

<p>“It’ll be all right, now,” the goblin assured him. “See? Off
we go again. And I’ll give her an extra turn for good speed; I’m
keen to get along toward home. It must be the middle of the forenoon.”</p>

<p>For an hour or two they sailed along steadily, covering mile
after mile of aërial space with the swiftness of an arrow. At last,
however, Bob remarked:</p>

<p>“Fitz, it appears to me we’re closer to the ocean than we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a while back; we must be descending. I wonder if the rain wet the
feathers in the bag.”</p>

<p>“No,” the goblin replied positively. “They can’t get wet.
They, and the bag, too, for that matter, have been treated with goose
oil; and they won’t wet.”</p>

<p>“Won’t wet?”</p>

<p>“No. You know a goose’s feathers never get wet, no matter
how much it goes in the water. We raise thousands of geese in
Goblinland just for the feathers and the oil to treat them and our
balloon bags with. We can’t be descending, Bob.”</p>

<p>But he stepped to the side of the car and cast his eyes upward.
Then suddenly he started and collapsed upon the seat, white and
trembling.</p>

<p>“What is it, what’s the matter, Fitz?” the lad questioned falteringly,
fearing what the answer would be.</p>

<p>“Bob,” his companion muttered hoarsely, “we are descending!
We’re lost—we’ll be drowned in the ocean! There’s a rip in the
bag and the feathers are escaping one by one!”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Bob drew a deep breath and dropped down
beside his companion. For several minutes
they sat silent, each staring stonily into the
other’s white face. At last the boy murmured
huskily:</p>

<p>“Fitz, are the feathers es—escaping very
fast? Can’t we do something to stop the leak?”</p>

<p>The goblin shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not very fast,” he said slowly, moistening his dry lips by
rubbing them together, “just one at a time.”</p>

<p>“Is the rip in the bag a very big one?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Bob brightened.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we climb up some way and fix it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The goblin gave a negative shake of the head.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, “it’s ’way up near the top of the bag.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’re we going to do, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing we <em>can</em> do, Bob. The feathers are escaping—one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
now and then; and, little by little, the balloon will lose its
buoyancy and sink into the sea. We’re lost!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Fitz,” Bob cried sharply. “Surely you’re not going
to give up that way. I didn’t think it of you. There must be something
we can do to save ourselves.”</p>

<p>The goblin dropped his chin upon his breast and, rolling his
head, muttered: “Nothing!”</p>

<p>“But,” the lad persisted, “we <em>must</em> do something. There’s a little
air still left in the tank, and when we sink too low we can let that
out, and rise again. If we sail as fast as we can, can’t we cross the
ocean before we drop into it?”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee leaped to his feet like one electrified.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bob—thank you!” he cried, grasping his companion’s
hand. “You’ve given me hope. We’ll try your project;
and if we lose, we’ll have the satisfaction of knowing we died trying!”
And he set his jaws with a resolute snap.</p>

<p>“I can’t see where there’ll be much satisfaction in that for us—after
we’re dead,” the lad muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>The goblin hurried to the selector, and gradually turned the
thumb-screw until the machine was wide open—the current was all
on.</p>

<p>The balloon instantly responded, and began to fly through the
air at a speed little short of miraculous; its two occupants had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
throw themselves prostrate and cling to the locker for safety. The
still summer air appeared to be blowing a hurricane; the placid,
heaving ocean appeared to be racing toward the west, a foaming,
tossing torrent. One by one, a few each minute, the feathers escaped
through the rent in the striped bag; and foot by foot, very slowly
and very surely, the aërial vehicle yielded to the overmastering power
of gravitation.</p>

<p>On, on and on they sped, reeling off miles as a watch ticks off
seconds. Neither the boy nor the goblin found anything to say.
Both fully realized that they were running a race with death, and the
knowledge awed them to silence.</p>

<p>The noon hour came, and still they were flying like mad, due
east.</p>

<p>Fitz cautiously lifted his head, put the binocular to his eyes, and
looked away toward the south.</p>

<p>“There’s the Azores,” he said, shouting in order to make himself
heard, his tone expressing relief and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The Azores?” Bob bellowed in reply.</p>

<p>“Yes—the islands.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’re making good time.”</p>

<p>“Well, hadn’t we better stop there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re only a few hundred feet above the water.”</p>

<p>The goblin shook his big head in a decided negative.</p>

<p>“Why not?” the boy insisted.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to stop there.”</p>

<p>“Afraid?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m afraid there’s no geese on those islands.”</p>

<p>“Geese?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve got to have goose feathers to refill our balloon
bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Well, what’re you going to try to do, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Going to try to make the coast of Portugal. We’ll find geese
there.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Portuguese.”</p>

<p>And Fitz Mee laughed at his own pun until his fat face became
purple and his breath came and went in wheezing gasps.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” Bob cried angrily. “This is no time to be
laughing.”</p>

<p>“Laughing will do just as much good as crying, Bob,” Fitz made
answer, but instantly sobering. “I believe we’ll come out all right.
There <em>are</em> geese in Portugal; and I think we’ll be able to make the
coast of that country. We’re making good time; and we’ve not had
to exhaust the air-tank yet. We’ll drive ahead and hope for the best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>One hour, two hours, three hours passed. The balloon descended
so low that the car threatened to dip into the waves. The
goblin released the remaining air in the tank, and again they soared
aloft, but only a few hundred feet. Another hour and again they
were dangerously near to the water.</p>

<p>Bob cried: “Why Fitz,
the sun’s ’most down! This
has been an awful short afternoon.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/drawing7.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Yes,” the goblin
nodded, “and the forenoon
was short, too. You must
remember we’re moving
east very rapidly—running
away from the sun, running
to meet the night.
It’ll be dark soon. I wish
we’d sight the coast; it
seems to me it’s about time
we were doing so.”</p>

<p>“What’s that wavy blue line ahead of us?” Bob inquired.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything,” Fitz answered.</p>

<p>“I do,” the boy insisted positively. “Give me the glass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must be land, then,” the goblin suggested.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> land!” Bob cried joyfully. “We’re going to be all right,
Fitz.”</p>

<p>“I—I hope so,” Fitz made answer; “I hope we’ll make it.”</p>

<p>Warned by his companion’s tone and manner that danger was
imminent, the lad jerked the binocular from his eyes and dropped
his gaze to the ocean. One glance was sufficient; the car was threatening
to dip into the water at any moment.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz!” the boy wailed. “What are we to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” Fitz whimpered, wringing his hands and wriggling
about upon the locker. “We can’t do anything—oh, we can’t
do anything! We’re lost—lost!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Fitz Mee, you old Convulsions!” Bob cried angrily.
“You got me into this thing; now you’ve got to help get me
out. Wake up! You’re playing the baby. And you called me a coward!
You’re the coward! Wake up!” roughly shaking him, “We’ve
got to throw something overboard; and I’ll throw <em>you</em>, in about a
minute.”</p>

<p>Just then the car hit the water a glancing spat that threw a
blinding cloud of brine over the two aëronauts. The balloon rebounded
from the impact and continued its mad speed.</p>

<p>“Whee!” screamed Fitz Mee. “You’re right, Bob. We must
lighten the balloon some way; one more lick like that will tear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
car loose from the bag. Raise the lids of the locker, and throw out
a lot of the old stuff we won’t need.”</p>

<p>Frantically they began to lighten ship, flinging into the sea odds
and ends of various kinds—the accumulation of many voyages. It
availed them little, however; the balloon ascended but a few feet,
and skimmed dangerously near to the water, into which it threatened
to take a final plunge at any moment.</p>

<p>Now the coast line was plainly visible to the naked eye; and now
it was but a few miles away, the hills and rocks standing out distinctly.
Yet how far off it seemed to the despairing aëronauts!
Neither spoke; each held his breath and his tongue, expecting to have
to make a final struggle and swim for life.</p>

<p>Lower and lower sank the balloon. Once more the car spatted
the water, and this time it did not rebound, but went tearing along
at railroad speed, deluging and almost drowning its occupants. For
a few minutes the two lost all sense of their surroundings, nearly
lost consciousness. Then the car struck the shelving, sandy shore
with a smart bump, and the balloon came to a full stop. The wild
and dangerous ride was over!</p>

<p>“Saved!” sputtered Fitz Mee, jumping from the car and dancing
up and down.</p>

<p>“Saved!” coughed Bob, indulging in similar antics.</p>

<p>Then they tearfully embraced, whirling round and round, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
saturated garments dripping a circle of wet upon the yellow sands.</p>

<p>The sun was gone from sight; the shades of night were stealing
in upon them.</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything to-night toward resuming our voyage,”
the goblin remarked; “it’s almost dark now. Then you’re wet and
weak and I’m famished and faint. We’ll spend the hours of darkness
here upon the warm sands, and in the morning we’ll look around
us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” the boy agreed; “I guess that’s the best we can do.”</p>

<p>By dint of a deal of tugging and grunting, they drew the balloon
up out of reach of wave and tide. Then they wrung their garments,
swallowed a number of food-tablets and drink-pellets and lay down
to sleep under the shelter of an overhanging cliff.</p>

<p>The sun was an hour high when they awoke. Simultaneously
they opened their eyes and sprang to their feet. Sleep had much refreshed
them; the warm air and sand had dried their garments.
After partaking of a hearty but hasty breakfast, they began to look
around them.</p>

<p>At their feet lay their balloon, a sorry wreck. But close examination
made plain the fact that it could be easily repaired and put in
shape. A short distance to the north a river put into the sea. They
sauntered to the mouth of it, and took in the view of the broad fertile
valley. A mile or two up the stream lay a small village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ve got to do, Bob,” Fitz remarked reflectively,
scratching his head.</p>

<p>“Well, what?” inquired the boy.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go into that town.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“For cord and goose feathers. We need the cord to splice the
broken ropes of our car, and we need the feathers to refill our bag.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the lad mumbled, “we need those articles all right, Fitz;
but maybe the people of the village don’t have such things.”</p>

<p>“Of course they do,” the goblin sneered superiorly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” the boy said tauntingly.</p>

<p>“Well, I know.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t; you just guess.”</p>

<p>“A goblin never guesses at anything.”</p>

<p>“I guess he does; you guessed we’d get drowned—but we
didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> shut up!”</p>

<p>“I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Neither will I!”</p>

<p>Then they stood and silently glared at each other for a full half
minute. Finally both began to look foolish, and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Fitz, you’re too hot-headed, you old Epilepsy,” Bob giggled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know it,” tittered the goblin; “but so are you, Roberty-Boberty.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” the boy admitted; “but I can’t stay mad at you,
Fitz.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay mad at you, either, Bob. Now let’s stop our foolishness
and go to that village, and see about the cord and feathers we
need.”</p>

<p>“All right. But how are we to get the things, Fitz? Have you
any money?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got gold; that’s just as good.”</p>

<p>“Gold?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Look here.”</p>

<p>The goblin took a bag of yellow nuggets from his pocket and
emptied them out and shook them before the boy’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Is that gold?” Bob inquired, interested and not a little excited.</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure,” Fitz Mee answered.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“In Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“Is there much of it there?”</p>

<p>“Bushels of it. These nuggets are as common there as pebbles
are in your country.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” the lad exclaimed, in wide-eyed wonder and admiration.
“You goblins must be mighty rich.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t put any value upon gold,” was the complacent reply;
“we never use it at home.”</p>

<p>Bob was thoughtfully silent for some seconds.</p>

<p>“What’re you thinking about?” his companion inquired with a
shrewd and cunning smile.</p>

<p>“Thinking how rich I can be
when I go back home,” was the a
frank admission. Then abruptly:
“What’s that coming down
the road yonder, Fitz?”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/drawing8.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Hello!” the goblin ejaculated
delightedly. “We won’t
have to tramp to the village.
That’s a gooseherd. See; he has
the geese tethered together with
twine and is guiding them with
a crook. We’ll wait here and
buy them of him.”</p>

<p>The gooseherd and his flock
drew near. He was a tall, angular young man, ragged and barefoot.
His merry whistle rose above the strident quacks of his charges, and
his flat feet softly spatted the dust of the highway in time to his own
music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Fitz Mee stepped forward, politely lifted his cap and said in
greeting:</p>

<p>“Good morning, Sir Gooseherd.”</p>

<p>The young man stopped in his tracks and dropped his crook
and his jaw at the same time. Plainly he was startled at the sudden
appearance of the little green sprite and his companion, and just as
plainly he was greatly frightened.</p>

<p>“We desire to purchase your geese,” the goblin ventured, boldly
advancing. “How much gold will buy them?”</p>

<p>The gooseherd let out a shrill yell of terror and turned and
fled up the road as fast as his long legs could carry him. The geese
attempted to flee also, but, being tethered together, became hopelessly
and helplessly entangled and fell to the ground, a flapping, quacking
mass.</p>

<p>Bob and Fitz laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” the goblin whooped. “The geese and cord are ours,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t pay the fellow,” Bob objected.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix that,” his comrade assured him. “When we’ve plucked
the feathers off the geese, I’ll tie the bag of nuggets around the neck
of one, and then we’ll turn ’em loose. The young fellow’ll find ’em
and get the gold. And now we must hurry up and get through with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
this job and be off from this coast; the gooseherd may come back and
bring his friends with him.”</p>

<p>The two diminutive aëronauts laboriously disentangled the geese
and drove them to the immediate vicinity of the wrecked balloon.
There they plucked the feathers off the quacking, quaking fowls, and
refilled the balloon-bag and closed the rent. Then they turned the
stripped and complaining birds loose, one meekly bearing the bag
of gold; and finally they spliced the broken ropes of the car and were
ready to resume their voyage.</p>

<p>“Jump in and pump up the tank a little, Bob,” Fitz cried joyfully.
“I’ll be ready to weigh anchor when you say the word.”</p>

<p>But at that moment came the patter of many feet upon the dry
sand, followed by a shower of clubs and stones that rattled about the
car and the heads of its occupants, and instantly the balloon was surrounded
by a crowd of gaping, leering villagers!</p>

<p>“Captured!” groaned Fitz Mee.</p>

<p>“Captured!” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>The villagers began to close in upon them, brandishing rude
weapons and uttering hoarse cries of rage.</p>

<p>In sheer desperation the goblin squirmed and grimaced, and
ended his ridiculous performance by uttering a blood-curdling
“boo!”</p>

<p>The startled villagers fell back in indecision and alarm, tumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
over one another in frantic efforts to get out of reach of the little
green sprite. Taking instant advantage of the respite, Bob whipped
out his knife and cut the anchor rope, and with a smart jerk the balloon
sprang aloft.</p>

<p>“Saved!” murmured the boy. “Saved, Fitz Mee!”</p>

<p>He received no answer; and he hurriedly turned to look for his
companion who, a moment before, had been at his side. Then he
sank back upon the locker, overcome with wonder and dismay. Fitz
Mee was not in the car; Bob was alone!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">IN WHICH BOB BECOMES A GIANT</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t-1.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The balloon was rapidly rising. Bob flew to the
air-tank and frantically worked the pump. Gradually
the primitive air-craft came to a stop, and
floated motionless several hundred feet above the
ground.</p>

<p>Then the boy hunkered upon the locker and
peered over the edge of the car. Distinctly he could hear the clamorous
cries and yells of the Portuguese; and in the center of the jeering,
hooting mob, he could barely distinguish his diminutive friend.
The sudden jerk of the car had thrown the goblin out, right among
the villagers; and they were dancing delightedly around the green
little sprite, clapping their hands and whooping themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>Bob caught up the binocular and directed it toward the scene
below him. After a momentary inspection, he settled back with a
sigh of partial relief.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re not going to kill him,” the boy muttered. “But
I wonder what they’ll do with him; and I wonder what’s to become
of <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Again he surveyed the scene below. The Portuguese were setting
off toward their village, bearing the kicking, screaming Fitz
Mee with them. A gigantic peasant carried the goblin in his arms.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” Bob murmured, in deep perplexity;
“I don’t know what I <em>can</em> do. I don’t know the way to Goblinland;
and so I can’t go there after help to rescue Fitz. I won’t go back
home and leave him to his fate, though; that would be mean and cowardly.
I—I don’t know what to—to do.”</p>

<p>A while he sat upon the locker, silently and thoughtfully peering
over the edge of the basket, occasionally putting the binocular to
his eyes. There was not a breath of air; and the balloon hung motionless
as a fleecy summer cloud. The boy saw the peasants making
their way up the valley to the outskirts of the village, and noted the
hub-bub that was raised among the other villagers, at the advent of
the goblin. Then the whole crowd disappeared among the trees and
buildings of the little hamlet. With a start, Bob roused himself.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do <em>something</em>,” he grumbled testily to himself; “I
can’t just float here always. Poor old Spasms! I’ve got to help him
out of the fix he’s got into, someway. I don’t believe he’d go back
on me—I don’t <em>believe</em> he would; and I won’t go back on him. But
what in the world can I do?” scratching his head and frowning.
“Oh, I’d like to be a giant just for a little while! If I wouldn’t
show those Portuguese a thing or two! I’d drop right down among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
’em, lick the last one of ’em—and carry Fitz away in the palm of my
hand. Oh! but that would be fine!” And he chuckled and wagged
his head.</p>

<p>Then an idea, suggested by his wish to be a giant, came to him;
and he leaped from his seat and hurried to the locker on the opposite
side of the car, and threw it open. After a momentary search, he
drew forth the hand-satchel containing the food-tablets and drink-pellets.</p>

<p>“I’ll just see, anyhow,” he whispered excitedly. “If the goblins
make tablets to shrink people, maybe they make some to swell ’em
up—make giants of ’em. I’ll just see.”</p>

<p>He opened the satchel and, squinting his eyes and wrinkling his
brows, commenced to mumble over the names upon the tiny bottles.</p>

<p>“Food-tablets—tiger-muscle, food-tablets—lion-heart, drink-pellets—pure
water, food-tablets—fat, gob-tabs—for dwarfing purposes.”</p>

<p>He grinned and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any more of those,” he grimaced; “I’m too small
for any good use now. It’s funny there isn’t any—ah! What’s this?
‘Giant-tabs—to be used only in cases of extreme need.’ I’ll bet those
are the very things I’m looking for. I’m going to try ’em, anyhow.
If there ever was a case of extreme need, this is one.”</p>

<p>He shook out one of the little tablets and was about to pop it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his mouth, when he started suddenly and sharply and shook his head,
muttering:</p>

<p>“It won’t do to take it now—till I get to the ground. It might
swell me up so big my weight would overcome the buoyancy of the
feathers or break the ropes of the car; and then I’d fall like a gob
of mud. I’ll have to wait till I’m out of the balloon before I make
the experiment. And it may get me into trouble when I do take the
stuff—I don’t know; it may poison me—or swell me up so fast I’ll
burst. Well, I don’t know what else to try; so I’ve got to do it.
Now I’ll just sail out over the town, the first thing, and see if I can
find out what those Portuguese have done with Fitz—poor old chap!
My! I almost wish I was out of all this mess of trouble, and back
home.”</p>

<p>He set the needle of the selector as he had seen the goblin do,
and gave a slight turn to the thumb-screw; and the balloon instantly
began to move toward the village a mile or so away. When his
vessel had reached a position directly over the little town, Bob shut
off the power and brought it to a standstill. Then he took his glass
and peered down among the roofs and treetops. He saw the people
congregated in the central square of the place. It was evident they
were holding some sort of public meeting. A speaker upon an improvised
platform was wildly talking and gesticulating; and the
other villagers were listening intently, mouths agape. Bob could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hear the words of the orator of the occasion, and was surprised and
pleased to learn that he could understand their meaning. The man
was saying:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/drawing9.jpg" width="400" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“My people,
I’ve called
you together
here to determine
what we
shall do with
this strange being
that has
landed upon our shores. The first thing to do,
however, is to ascertain what the thing is. It’s
not a man—that’s plain; and I’d like an expression
of opinion from you as to what you consider it to
be. Speak out, now.”</p>

<p>“It’s a big green frog,” said one man.</p>

<p>Bob smiled as he listened.</p>

<p>“It’s a green parrot without feathers,”
said another.</p>

<p>Bob grinned.</p>

<p>“It’s a green devil,” ventured a third.</p>

<p>Bob chuckled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a green monkey,” opined a fourth.</p>

<p>Bob laughed outright.</p>

<p>And the peasants heard him, and cast their gaze aloft; and immediately
began to gesticulate and vociferate excitedly.</p>

<p>“I’m a goblin, you fools!” croaked a familiar voice. “I’m a
goblin, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Bob then saw his friend. The latter was confined in a parrot
cage hanging upon a post in front of a building. The speaker—who,
it was plain, was in authority—quieted the populace; and then he
continued:</p>

<p>“As you will perceive, there’s another one of the strange beings
up there in that balloon. Now, my opinion is that they’re moon-men
from the moon. As you all know, the moon’s made of green cheese;
and that would account for the color of them.”</p>

<p>“But the one up there <em>isn’t</em> green,” a woman objected; “he’s
<em>gray</em>.”</p>

<p>“No doubt he’s old and faded,” the speaker explained.</p>

<p>Bob laughed heartily; then listened intently, for the official was
saying:</p>

<p>“My opinion is that these moon-men have come to bring a pestilence
upon us, my children; and if we do not rid ourselves of them,
we will suffer greatly. So I condemn them to death. This one
that, by your great prowess and bravery, you have already captured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
we will execute at sunset; and bury him with a great stone upon him,
that he may know no resurrection. The other one must be captured.
We must think of some plan to entice him within our reach. Let
us adjourn to my official residence, there to consider the grave matter.”</p>

<p>Soon the street was apparently deserted; but the boy could see
guards peeping from places of concealment.</p>

<p>“Bob!” Fitz Mee called softly. “Hello, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Fitz!” the lad answered.</p>

<p>“Come down and get me—quick!”</p>

<p>“I don’t dare, Fitz; they’re watching.”</p>

<p>“But you must get me out of this fix, Bob, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Fitz. But how?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you think of a plan? I’m so scared I <em>can’t</em> think.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of <em>one</em> plan.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Bob gave a few strokes to the air-pump; and the balloon sank almost
to the level of the treetops. Then the boy said, cautiously:</p>

<p>“Fitz, do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is the plan I’ve thought of: I’ve found some giant-tabs
in your portable pantry; and I think of taking one of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s the thing,” Fitz interrupted gleefully. “You’re a genius,
Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“It won’t hurt me—the medicine, will it?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Just make a giant of me?”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“And I can go back to boy size or goblin size, when I want to?”</p>

<p>“Yes; all you’ll have to do is to take a few gob-tabs.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! more pills. Well, all right; I’ll do it, then. I’ll make
a giant of myself, and sail in and knock these Portuguese galley-west—and
carry you off.”</p>

<p>“Well, do it right now,” Fitz cried impatiently.</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?” peevishly.</p>

<p>“I don’t dare take the giant-tabs till I’m upon the ground, you
understand; my size would wreck the balloon. And I don’t dare to
come to the ground, right here and right now; the Portuguese would
capture me before I could do anything. See?”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” Fitz Mee admitted, disappointment in his voice. “But
what <em>are</em> you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going over the hills out of sight, drop to the ground there,
and hide the balloon, and then come back afoot.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be very long about it, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s no hurry. They don’t mean to kill you till sunset,
Fitz.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, do you think I want to stay cooped up here all day?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t get impatient, Fitzy,” the boy giggled.</p>

<p>“You stop your laughing,” the goblin grumbled. “It isn’t
funny.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” tauntingly.</p>

<p>“No, it <em>isn’t</em>, Roberty-Boberty!”</p>

<p>“Yeah—yeah! Old Epilepsy!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> shut up!”</p>

<p>“Say, Bob?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You <em>will</em> hurry, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes! But say, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“How is it that I can understand what these Portuguese say?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know we goblins can understand any language.”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> goblins?” the boy cried sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Fitz chuckled.</p>

<p>“I’m no goblin,” Bob asserted stoutly; “I’m a Yankee.”</p>

<p>“You’re a goblin—half goblin, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I’m <em>not</em>!”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em>! You’ve taken gob-tabs; and that makes you partly
goblin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fitz Mee,” the boy yelled, “you mean old thing! You say
that again, and I’ll sail off home—and leave you right where you
are.”</p>

<p>“I won’t <em>say</em> it any more, Bob; but it’s <em>so</em>.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Fitz; I’m going.”</p>

<p>“Not home?”</p>

<p>“No; over the hills.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry back.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Bob released a little of the pent air in the tank, and soared high
above the earth; then he manipulated the selector and sped away over
the hills out of sight of the village. When he thought it safe, he
worked the pump and descended to the earth. There he made the
balloon fast in a secluded spot near the highway—by tying it securely
to a tree, with the piece of anchor-rope remaining.</p>

<p>“There,” he breathed softly, “I’ll know where to find my air-ship;
I’ll remember the place by this big funny-looking stone here at
the roadside. Now I’ll take my medicine and be off to the rescue
of my good comrade, Fitz Mee.”</p>

<p>He took one of the tiny giant-tabs and swallowed it; and immediately
he began to grow and grow—clothes and all. He stretched
up, up till his head was on a level with the tops of the smaller trees;
and he spread out till he was as big in girth as the trunks of the largest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonderful!” he ejaculated, and his voice almost frightened
him; it was as coarse and hoarse as the roar of a lion. He looked
at his hands and feet—and laughed. They were as large as hams of
meat; and his limbs were like the great limbs of an elephant.
Proudly he strode about, crooking his arm and feeling his biceps
muscle and muttering to himself:</p>

<p>“Won’t I make a scatterment among those Portuguese! I’ll
scare ’em all into conniption fits. But I won’t hurt any of ’em, unless
I have to; that would be wrong, cruel—just like a big man whipping
a little boy. But I must be off; Fitz will be tired of waiting. I
wonder how far I’ve got to walk. My! but I’m <em>hungry</em>; and I want
<em>meat</em>.”</p>

<p>He picked up a large knotted pole for a cane and set off along
the road, whistling; and his whistle was as loud as that of a calliope.
The birds flew away in affright; and the hares and other small
animals scampered into the depths of the forest. Bob smiled complacently,
recklessly swinging his big knotted club.</p>

<p>Presently he approached a hut by the roadside; and he went up
to it and knocked upon the swinging door. An old woman put in
an appearance; but, at sight of her gigantic caller, she let out a yell
and fled back into the dusky interior.</p>

<p>Bob turned the corner of the cabin,—his head overtopped the comb
of the roof by several feet!—and dropped upon hands and knees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
crawled into the kitchen. The poor old woman again caught sight
of him; and fled from the premises, screaming shrilly. Bob pitied
her and called to her to come back, that he meant her no harm; but
his awful bellowing voice served only to frighten her the more.
The boy-giant—or the giant-boy, or whatever he should be
called—discovered upon the table in
the center of the floor a leg of
roast mutton, a loaf of black
bread, a jug of milk and some
fruit; and ravenously devoured
the whole. Then he
retreated from the kitchen;
and, feeling much refreshed,
resumed his way toward the
village, taking strides fully fifteen
feet long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/drawing10.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But when he had gone a short
distance, he met the old woman whose
food he had eaten returning toward her
home, accompanied by her husband. The man had been at work
in the fields; and now he was walking rapidly, his head down, cracking
his fists and valiantly declaring what he would do to the bold
intruder when he encountered him. Bob heard the fellow’s rash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
threats, and gave a loud laugh. The man flung up his head, took
one look at the boy-giant—and incontinently took to his heels, literally
dragging his wife after him. Across the fields they flew, and
disappeared in a bit of woodland; and Bob pursued his course unmolested,
still laughing boisterously. It was all so very funny!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illustration3.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">He picked up a large knotted pole for a cane.</p>
</div>

<p>Shortly he reached the top of the hill, where he could look down
upon the little village, whose inhabitants were all unconscious of the
terrible being that was approaching it. There the boy-giant paused
to consider. Shaking his head he muttered, a grin spreading over
his coarse features:</p>

<p>“Well, those giant-tabs have increased my size wonderfully, but
I don’t feel that they’ve increased my courage in the same way. I’m
almost afraid to go down into that town. Those Portuguese might
take it into their heads to shoot; and I’d be such a big mark they
<em>couldn’t</em> miss me. But I guess there’s no other way; so here goes.”</p>

<p>He loped off down the hill; and a few minutes later he was entering
the village. Some children at play saw him coming and ran
ahead of him, screaming frantically. A woman came to her door,
and immediately followed the children, also yelling at the top of her
voice. Several men hastily put in an appearance; and as hastily
joined the woman and children, in a mad race toward the public
square of the town. The alarm spread. Others, and still others—of
both sexes and all ages and sizes—emerged from concealment; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sought safety in mad flight, all speeding toward one destination, the
mayor’s official residence.</p>

<p>The mayor and his officers and advisors heard the hub-bub and
poured forth to ascertain the cause of it; and when the boy-giant arrived
at the town’s place of public gathering, there they all were, yelling,
screaming, shouting and gesticulating.</p>

<p>Bob swung his big club and bellowed “boo! boo! boo!” as loud
as he could; and the frightened people tumbled over one another in
an effort to hurry to places of security. The mayor led the way,
closely followed by his officers. All deserted the place but one old
soldier. He ran at Bob, a rusty sword in his hand, and tried to hack
the boy-giant’s legs; and the latter had to snatch the sword away from
the pugnacious old warrior and take him across his knee and spank
him soundly, before he would consent to behave. However, when
at last the boy-giant set the old fellow upon the ground, he scampered
away as fast as he could limp.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob—Bob!” Fitz Mee cried pipingly, piteously, a hint
of tears in his voice. “I’m <em>so</em> glad you’ve come. They had just
decided to execute me at noon; and it wants only an hour of the
time.”</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as a mile, Fitz,” Bob laughed. “But we must
get out of here before they recover their wits and their courage, and
return; they might shoot us. My! but didn’t that old soldier want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to fight? A few like him would have given me a lot of trouble.
Well, here we go—for safety and a better country.”</p>

<p>And he took the parrot cage containing the goblin under arm,
and made a hurried retreat from the village.</p>

<span class="smaller">LOST IN THE DESERT</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a-1.jpg" width="175" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">As Bob moved rapidly along the country road,
bearing his comrade in the parrot cage, he
could hear the sounds of clamor and pursuit
behind him—the barking of dogs, the confused
shouting and yelling of men, and the
booming and cracking of fire-arms.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Bob, hurry!” squeaked Fitz Mee.
“They’re after us!”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/drawing11.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Yes, but their legs are too short,”
Bob chuckled; “they won’t catch us.
Don’t you worry, my teenty-weenty
green frog, the naughty men shan’t
hurt you.” And he held the parrot
cage up in front of him, and with his
finger playfully poked Fitz Mee in
the ribs.</p>

<p>“Quit that!” croaked the
goblin. “And don’t you call me
a green frog any more, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pretty little green monkey, that’s what it is!” Bob laughed,
teasingly.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” snapped Fitz.</p>

<p>“Nice little green devil!” the boy-giant continued, shaking with
laughter.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” screeched the goblin. “Shut up, I say! I’ll scratch
you; I’ll bite you!”</p>

<p>“Sweet-tempered little green moon-man!” Bob persisted.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bob Taylor!” Fitz cried, vexed and desperate. “If
you don’t quit calling me names, I’ll—I’ll run off and leave you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” the boy-giant returned placidly, “I’ll just set you
down here in the road and let you run off.”</p>

<p>And he suited his action to his words.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, please don’t, Bob!” Fitz Mee pleaded, almost in
tears. “Let me out of this cage, and take me up and go ahead. And
don’t plague me any more, just because you’re so big and so strong.
It isn’t like you, Bob—to be so cruel. I don’t like you as a giant;
I’d rather have you as a goblin—as a boy, I mean—and I’ll be glad
when you’re back in that state again.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I won’t be a boy or a goblin any more,” Bob remarked
thoughtfully, as he released his companion and took him up in his
arms; “maybe I’ll just remain a giant. I rather like being a giant;
I don’t have to take pills when I’m a giant. I can eat meat and
things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you can’t go in the balloon, as a giant,” Fitz Mee suggested.</p>

<p>“No, that’s so. Well, maybe I won’t go in it any more; maybe
you don’t want me to.”</p>

<p>“You know I do, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Aren’t we on our way to Goblinland, to have the
time of our lives—hey?” shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go back to the form of a goblin, then, Fitz; but—ugh!—I
don’t like the <em>pills</em>!”</p>

<p>They topped the hill and reached the hut where Bob had taken
the old woman’s dinner. He told the goblin what he had done, and
the goblin chuckled and spluttered in great glee. The boy-giant
shook him and said to him:</p>

<p>“Have you any more gold about you?”</p>

<p>“A little,” the green sprite made reply. “Why?”</p>

<p>“I want it.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To pay that old woman for the dinner I ate.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t have it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t?”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t!”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s <em>my</em> gold, not <em>yours</em>.”</p>

<p>“I know, Fitz; but you’ll let me have it.”</p>

<p>“<em>Will</em> I? Not much, Roberty-Boberty!”</p>

<p>“Take care!” Bob cried, giving the tiny fellow a threatening
shake. “Remember I’m a giant right now, and liable to lose my
temper. And don’t you call me any more names, I warn you. Now,
hand over that gold.”</p>

<p>“You’re a robber, that’s what you are, Rob Taylor,” the goblin
complained sullenly, fumbling in his pocket for the gold demanded.</p>

<p>“And you’re a mischievous, ill-tempered little pest,” Bob
laughed.</p>

<p>At last, with apparent reluctance, the goblin dropped two or
three nuggets into the boy-giant’s broad palm.</p>

<p>“There!” he muttered. “But I don’t see what you want to pay
the old woman for.”</p>

<p>“Because it’s <em>right</em> to pay her,” Bob explained; “I took her dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” giggling.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And you <em>know</em> it’s right, Fitz; you’re just plaguing
me.”</p>

<p>“Think so?”—laughing. “Well, pay her. But hurry up about
it; I hear our pursuers coming. You’ll fool around and get us
trapped, if you don’t look sharp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here!” Bob cried, dropping the goblin to the ground and returning
the gold to him. “You go to the door and pay her. If she
sees me, she’ll run away again. Go on; I’ll hide.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/drawing12.jpg" width="500" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>With the words he stepped aside among the trees that bordered
the road; and the goblin ran to the door of the hut and kicked upon
it. There was silence in the cabin for several moments; then the
door screaked on its hinges and slowly swung open. The old man
and old woman were both there; but as soon as they caught sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the green little being, they were more frightened than they had been
at sight of the giant. With a great flirting of skirts and shaking of
trousers, they leaped right over the goblin’s head and sped away to
the fields again, yelling lustily. Fitz Mee rolled upon the ground,
laughing immoderately; and Bob joined in his companion’s merriment.
However, he called to him:</p>

<p>“Throw the gold upon the floor—and come on; they’ll find it, if
they ever pluck up courage to come back to their house. Come on;
we’ve got to hurry.”</p>

<p>The boy-giant caught up his wee comrade and ran as fast as he
could toward the place where he had hid the balloon. The sounds
of pursuit were close behind them. Into the woods Bob dashed and
crashed; and soon he stood beside the air-vessel.</p>

<p>“Open the satchel and get me a gob-tab—quick!” he bellowed to
Fitz, tossing him into the basket.</p>

<p>“A gob-tab?” squeaked Fitz.</p>

<p>“Yes—quick!”</p>

<p>“<em>One</em> won’t do you any good.”</p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>“No; you’ll have to take a half-dozen. Here they are.”</p>

<p>“Have I got to swallow all those pills?”</p>

<p>“Yes, down ’em—and be nimble about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>won’t</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Bob!” coaxingly.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” stubbornly. “You <em>know</em> I don’t like pills!”</p>

<p>“Bob, you’ll get us into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’d rather get into trouble than have trouble get
into me; and that’s what pills are—trouble.”</p>

<p>Just then came a loud rattling and crashing of the underbrush;
and a large number of men and boys and dogs burst into the little
open space and surrounded the two adventurers.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” cried the mayor.</p>

<p>“Get out!” roared the boy-giant in answer. And he set into
kicking the too inquisitive dogs and cuffing the too venturesome men
in a strenuous manner that made them fall back to a respectful distance—and
in a great hurry.</p>

<p>“Untie the balloon!” Bob bawled to his companion. “And give
me those gob-tabs!”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee did as directed.</p>

<p>“Boo! boo! boo!” roared the boy-giant, leaping and dancing
awkwardly about.</p>

<p>“At ’em again!” commanded the mayor. “But don’t shoot; capture
’em alive!”</p>

<p>Again men and boys and dogs began to close in upon the aëronauts.
Fitz Mee signalled that the balloon was in readiness. Bob
clapped the six gob-tabs into his mouth and hastily swallowed them—making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a ridiculously grotesque face that caused his enemies to
hesitate in their advance upon him. Then he tried to let out another
startling “boo.” It started off all right, big and coarse and awful;
but it ended in a tiny dribbling squeak that was so funny that the
goblin dropped to the bottom of the car, squirming and laughing.
Bob had suddenly shrunk to goblin size.</p>

<p>“A miracle!” cried the mayor, crossing himself and retreating.</p>

<p>“A miracle!” seconded his people, following his example.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the momentary respite in his favor, Bob
jumped into the car. Fitz released the air; and away the balloon
soared—up through the treetops—to the fleecy clouds far, far above
the earth. Cries and wails of disappointment and chagrin followed
the daring aëronauts.</p>

<p>“Saved again!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Saved again!” croaked Fitz.</p>

<p>“They came near catching us!” the boy panted.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it was all your fault,” the goblin grumbled.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” Bob cried sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, you wouldn’t take the gob-tabs, and that delayed us—that’s
how,” Fitz Mee retorted.</p>

<p>“Yes, and <em>you</em> lay down and laughed in the old woman’s door-yard;
and that delayed us, too.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“It did!”</p>

<p>“It <em>didn’t</em>, I say!”</p>

<p>“It <em>did</em>, I say!”</p>

<p>“Bob, you’re a contrary boy, that’s what <em>you</em> are!”</p>

<p>“And, Fitz, you’re a stubborn goblin, that’s what <em>you</em> are!”</p>

<p>Then they sat upon the locker and glared at each other—and
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, we got away, anyhow,” Fitz said.</p>

<p>“That’s what we did,” Bob replied.</p>

<p>“Let’s be off.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Here’s for Goblinland!” waving his arms.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” waving his cap.</p>

<p>Fitz began to manipulate the selector.</p>

<p>“You haven’t set that needle right,” the boy objected.</p>

<p>“Huh?”—sharply.</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“Goblinland’s east from here, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve set that needle pointing west.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“You have, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Bob, the sun rises in the east, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“To be sure.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s afternoon now, and the sun’s in the west; and you’ve
set the indicator pointing straight toward it.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s forenoon; and the sun’s in the east.”</p>

<p>“Fitz, you’re <em>wrong</em>.”</p>

<p>“Bob, I’m <em>not</em>.”</p>

<p>“You’ll <em>see</em>.”</p>

<p>“<em>You’ll</em> see.”</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee, you don’t know anything.”</p>

<p>“Bob Taylor, I know everything.”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes</em>, you do!”</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em>!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” the boy sneered. “You didn’t know enough to loose the
latch of a parrot cage and let yourself out.”</p>

<p>“And <em>you</em> didn’t know enough to take gob-tabs when you needed
’em.”</p>

<p>“Yeah!”</p>

<p>“Yeah!”</p>

<p>Both remained sullenly silent for some seconds. Then Bob said
grumblingly:</p>

<p>“All right, Fitz Mee, have your way. You’ll see, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The goblin made no reply; he simply turned the thumb-screw of
the selector, and the balloon sailed away upon its course rapidly and
gracefully. Presently, however, Fitz gave a start and muttered:</p>

<p>“Why, we’re out over the water again; and we ought to be crossing
the mountains. I wonder what’s the matter—eh, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s nothing the matter,” snickered Bob, “except we’re
going west, as I told you—going back to America.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/drawing13.jpg" width="500" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Bob, I—I guess you’re right,” Fitz admitted, reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m right,” the boy said, swelling with supreme self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well,” muttered the goblin, “we can turn around and go the
other way; and we <em>will</em>.”</p>

<p>With that he again began to busy himself with the selector. But
in a moment he mumbled peevishly:</p>

<p>“Why—why, what’s the matter with this thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” the boy inquired.</p>

<p>“The needle won’t turn at all, Bob.”</p>

<p>“It won’t?” stooping to examine.</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. See?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What do you suppose ails it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand your own machinery, Fitz Mee of Goblinland?”
teasingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do—when a certain boy from Yankeeland hasn’t meddled
with it,” crossly.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You think I hurt your old machine?”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> you did—in some way.”</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee, I wish I’d left you in the hands of the Portuguese.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t.”</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em>!”</p>

<p>“Now, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you say I spoiled the selector for?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean you did it on purpose, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; I just meant you did it by accident. It’s a very delicate
instrument, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, it’s done and can’t be helped. It appears that I’ve
set the indicator west instead of east, so west we must go. It’ll be a
longer journey, but who cares! We’ll sail right back across America
and over the Pacific. I’ll open her up and let her fly.”</p>

<p>He gave a turn or two to the thumb-screw; and the balloon shot
forward—at the speed of a comet, almost. The two aëronauts
dropped flat upon the floor of the car and remained silent, for the uproar
occasioned by their rapid passage through the air prevented
conversation. Soon, however, the mercurial boy grew restless; and
he cautiously drew himself up across the locker and peeped over
the edge of the basket. The goblin caught his venturesome companion
by the heels and attempted to draw him back; but Bob wriggled
and gesticulated, pointing downward over the rim of the basket,
and finally grabbed Fitz by the arm and pulled him up on to the
locker. The goblin took one peep; then rolled to the bottom of the
car, and tightened the thumb-screw and gradually brought the balloon
to a standstill.</p>

<p>“We’re over the land again,” Bob gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes,” panted Fitz Mee, climbing to his comrade’s side.</p>

<p>“Well, what does it mean? We haven’t reached America already,
have we?”</p>

<p>The goblin shook his head, frowning in a puzzled way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, where are we, then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Fitz, we’re lost.”</p>

<p>“I guess we are, Bob.”</p>

<p>The boy took up the binocular and looked all around.</p>

<p>“Why!” he exclaimed. “There’s a city ’way back yonder on the
coast, an odd-looking city like the pictures in my geography; and
there’s nothing out there ahead of us but sand—sand—sand, as far as
I can see.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Fitz Mee.</p>

<p>Then he rolled to the floor of the car, laughing immoderately
and holding his sides and kicking up his heels.</p>

<p>“Look here!” the boy cried angrily. “What’s the matter with
you, old Convulsions? What’s so funny, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, Bob,” Fitz said, getting upon his feet and wiping
his pop eyes upon the long tails of his coat, “we’re a pair of precious
ninnies. We’ve been traveling south all the time—instead of east
as I thought, or west as you thought. And here we are in Africa.
We’ve crossed the narrow part of the Mediterranean; and we’re now
in the southern edge of Morocco—right over the Sahara desert!”</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b-2.jpg" width="175" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Bob looked very sober, and said nothing; and
Fitz continued:</p>

<p>“So you see we were both wrong; we forgot
that the sun is south at noon—that’s all.
Isn’t it funny?” and again the goblin laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it very funny,” the boy replied,
pouting his lips, and looking very glum.</p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because here we are in the desert—away south of where we
ought to be; and the selector won’t work, and we can’t go back—can’t
go in any direction but south. If we keep on, we’ll just come to
the south pole—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Say!” the goblin cried. “I never thought of that, Bob. That’s
so; and we’re in a fix, sure.” Then, after wrinkling his forehead
and blinking thoughtfully for a few moments: “Well, there’s just
one thing to do: we’ve got to fix the selector—got to find out what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ails it and set it right. We’ll travel on till we come to an oasis; and
there we’ll descend to the ground, and I’ll tinker the machine.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you do it here and now?” Bob suggested.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I might get us into worse trouble, Bob; might shake
the thing up in some way that would cause it to run away with us.
It’s tricky sometimes. No, I’ll wait till we come to an oasis; then I’ll
work at it on the ground.”</p>

<p>“All right. And I’ll work my teeth upon some ripe dates and
any other fruit I can find.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Bob,”—setting the balloon in motion,—“that
we haven’t had any dinner; and it’s getting late in the afternoon.
Why didn’t you mention that you were getting hungry?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m not <em>very</em> hungry; you know I had a big meal that I
got from the old woman’s table. But you haven’t eaten anything
since morning, have you, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll eat now as we go along; and you can join me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>can</em> I?” contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“You’re very kind.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hungry?”</p>

<p>“Not hungry enough to take pills.”</p>

<p>“Bob, I tell you they’re <em>not</em> pills; they’re food tablets.”</p>

<p>“They’re pills all the same, Fitz; and I won’t take ’em when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
can get anything else. And I think I’ll find some fruit when we
reach an oasis.”</p>

<p>The goblin said no more; but silently opened the hand-satchel,
and took out and swallowed a number of the tiny tablets and pellets,
smacking his lips in a manner that made his companion turn up his
nose in disgust.</p>

<p>The sun was slowly sinking in the west. Bob had the binocular
to his eyes and was sweeping the southern horizon. Suddenly he
cried:</p>

<p>“Look! Look, Fitz! We’re coming to a great city!”</p>

<p>The goblin smiled pityingly, wagging his head and rolling his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see it?” the boy asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The goblin nodded, still smiling. Bob leveled his glass upon
the distant city and continued to observe it. It was a most beautiful
sight, that city. It stood upon the bank of a blue lake; and its white
walls, its domes and spires, glistened in the rays of the declining sun.
But gradually it began to fade away; and little by little it disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>“Why—why,” the boy cried, “what’s become of it, Fitz? I can’t
see it any more. What’s become of it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” the goblin snickered.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“You didn’t see any city, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I know I <em>did</em>! Think I can’t <em>see</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can see; but you didn’t see any city.”</p>

<p>“What did I see, then?”</p>

<p>“A mirage.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Was that all it was?”</p>

<p>“That was all.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was beautiful, anyway. And there’s another one—a
lot of grass and green trees this time.”</p>

<p>“That’s an oasis.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s just another mirage.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s an oasis. See! It’s getting closer and clearer all the
time. There’s where we’ll stop.”</p>

<p>The swift speed of their air-vessel soon brought them to the
green oasis. There they descended to the earth, pumped the tank
full of air, and firmly secured the balloon to a tree. Then Fitz set
about to repair the selector, and Bob began to search for fruit. The
boy was successful in his quest and soon returned to his comrade, his
cap full of luscious dates. The goblin was sitting upon the ground,
his back against the side of the basket, apparently glum and half
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have some, Fitz,” the boy mumbled, his mouth full of fruit,
offering a share to his companion. Fitz drowsily shook his head.</p>

<p>“Did you get the selector fixed?” Bob inquired.</p>

<p>The goblin nodded, batting his eyes.</p>

<p>“I—I <em>guess</em> I’ve got it fixed,” he said.</p>

<p>“What was the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Bob. I never had a
selector act like this one does; I’m afraid
it’s permanently magnetized.”</p>

<p>“Why, what would put it in that
condition, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do. Out with it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to scare you, Bob,
but—”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/drawing14.jpg" width="200" height="475" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Scare me? Pooh! Out with it.”</p>

<p>“Well, down here in Africa somewhere—I
don’t know just where—there’s a magnetic
mountain; and we goblins have had
trouble with it. Whenever we get within
the zone of its power with our balloons,
it magnetizes our selectors so they
won’t work right; and if we get too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
close, it draws us to it—and we have great trouble in getting away.
Some of my countrymen have had to abandon their balloons and walk
miles and miles, and then send a wireless message home for help.”</p>

<p>“Is that <em>so</em>?”—mouth agape.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“And you think that’s what ails our selector?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’re we going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“There’s very little we <em>can</em> do—if that’s what’s the matter with
our machine. It seems to be all right now; but you must remember
we’re on the ground, with other mountains between us and the magnetic
peak—breaking its power, as it were. Probably when we’re
high in the air again, we’ll encounter the old difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better sail as close to the earth as we can, Fitz, till
we’re beyond the influence of that strange mountain.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, Bob; I’d already thought of it. And, as
the sun’s almost down and we’ll need to see our way when travelling
close to the ground, I think we’d better spend the night here, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But—but say, Fitz!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“If you need to send a wireless phone message to Goblinland,
how do you do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Fitz Mee silently drew from his pocket a small shiny metallic
box, and opened it. It contained a tiny telephone instrument, perfect
in every detail—speaking-tube, receiver and all.</p>

<p>“My!” the boy exclaimed in admiration and wonder. “Isn’t
it pretty and isn’t it little! But how do you use it, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Just like you use any telephone,” the goblin replied complacently.</p>

<p>“Do you take down that teenty-weenty little receiver and call up
central in Goblinland?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And central gives you whatever number you want?”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded.</p>

<p>“Say!” the boy cried excitedly. “Call up some one right now,
Fitz.”</p>

<p>The goblin shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bob insisted; “I want to see how it works.”</p>

<p>“I don’t dare to.”</p>

<p>“Don’t <em>dare</em> to?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“There’s a law against using the instrument, except for messages
of grave importance.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee closed the little box and returned it to his pocket; Bob
resumed the munching of his ripe fruit.</p>

<p>“Won’t you have some, Fitz?” he suggested, temptingly displaying
it to the goblin’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Uk-uh!” Fitz grunted.</p>

<p>“Better try some; it’s fine.”</p>

<p>“It would make me sick.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!”—incredulously, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would; I’m afraid it will make <em>you</em> sick.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Fruit never makes <em>me</em> sick; I can eat bushels of it.”</p>

<p>“You mean you <em>could</em>.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You could—when you were a boy.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re part goblin now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m <em>not</em>!”</p>

<p>“You’ll see, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>will</em> see; I’ll eat this fruit and prove to you, Fitzy, that
I’m just a healthy boy.”</p>

<p>“All right,” the goblin grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob finished his fruit—to the last date. Then he went to the
great spring near at hand, and lay down and drank his fill. He set
out to return to his comrade; but suddenly he became so ill that he
dropped upon the ground and rolled and writhed and groaned. Fitz
came flying to him.</p>

<p>“Here, Bob,” he said quietly, “take this,” offering the wriggling
boy a tablet.</p>

<p>“Oh! pills! pills! pills!” Bob moaned. But he took the tablet
and downed it; and soon he was relieved of the fruit—and his
pain. Sheepishly he got on his feet and sauntered back to the balloon,
crestfallen and subdued. All Fitz Mee said to him was:</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll know enough to stick to goblin diet after this.”</p>

<p>And Bob made no reply.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down; dusky shadows were gathering from far
and near and throwing themselves prone upon the desert sands. The
air, that all the afternoon had been so hot, was growing chill.</p>

<p>“I’m sleepy,” Bob remarked, dropping upon the warm earth and
stretching full length.</p>

<p>“Well, you mustn’t go to sleep there,” Fitz replied.</p>

<p>“Why?” the boy queried.</p>

<p>“You’ll see why when it grows a little darker. Wild beasts will
be prowling around here, after food and water.”</p>

<p>“They will?” raising himself upon his elbow and glancing apprehensively
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” the goblin answered.</p>

<p>“Lions?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Leopards?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“And hyenas and jackals?”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, where are we going to sleep, then?”</p>

<p>“We’ll let the balloon rise to the level of the tops of these palm
trees, tie it there, and sleep in the car.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do. But I’ll bet we don’t get much sleep; the wild animals
will raise such a rumpus, roaring and howling and fighting.
Won’t they?”</p>

<p>“It’s likely.”</p>

<p>“Dear—dear! I wish I was back home.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I do, too. You promised to take me to Goblinland where
everything was to be lovely; and you’ve got me away down here in the
Sahara desert where there’s nothing but sand and wild beasts. And
you’ve got me in such a fix I can’t eat a little fruit, even, without
getting sick; and now I’m to have no sleep. Bah!”</p>

<p>“That’s all that ails you, Bob.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re sleepy—and cross.”</p>

<p>“I’m not cross.”</p>

<p>“Well—well, we won’t argue the matter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll argue if I want to, old Epilepsy.”</p>

<p>“Say, Bob,”—pleasantly.</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“Bob.”</p>

<p>“Huh!”—ungraciously.</p>

<p>“I think I know what we can do to send the wild animals about
their business if they bother us.”</p>

<p>“What?”—with a show of interest.</p>

<p>“That is,” with a reflective shake of the head, “if we didn’t throw
overboard, when we were about to sink in the Atlantic, the stuff we
need.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Magnetic powder.”</p>

<p>“There’s a bottle of it in the locker; I saw it there this morning.
But what on earth are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. I’m going to sprinkle some of it in the spring;
and it’ll magnetize the water. Then any animal that comes for a
drink will get a shock that will stir up its ideas—and send it flying.
Won’t that be great?”</p>

<p>“Great?” Bob cried, capering about in glee. “Yes, indeed, Fitz!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
And won’t it be funny to hear ’em and see ’em? I’m not a bit sleepy
now. Let’s fix the spring right now.”</p>

<p>Soon they had magnetized the spring, and had snuggled down in
the car of their balloon, to spend the night. By that time it was
quite dark; so they partook of a few food-tablets and drink-pellets,
and then composed themselves to rest—out of reach of any beast that
might come prowling around. Bob dropped into a doze. A roar
like distant, muttering thunder roused him. He sat up and rubbed
his eyes; then he nudged his sleeping companion.</p>

<p>“Huh!” ejaculated Fitz, waking with a start.</p>

<p>“I heard something roaring—sounded like thunder,” the boy
explained.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I wasn’t wide enough awake to tell. There—there
it goes again.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lion out on the sands,” chuckled the goblin; “he’s coming
for a drink. Now the fun’ll begin, Bob.”</p>

<p>“And listen! What are those other sounds, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Jackals barking and hyenas howling. They’re all coming at
once. There’ll be a circus when they gather at the spring.”</p>

<p>The two aëronauts giggled and shrugged their shoulders, in nervous
but delicious expectancy. The moon made the night almost as
light as day; but soon great dark shapes and shadows were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
seen approaching the oasis, from various directions. The lion roared
defiantly, the jackals barked snappishly and the hyenas howled dolefully.</p>

<p>“I see the lion,” Bob whispered excitedly. “There! He’s just
coming in among the trees. But what’s that other animal creeping
along away out there in the bright moonlight?”</p>

<p>“A leopard,” Fitz replied.</p>

<p>“And that pack of little fellows are jackals?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And those ugly scrawny ones are hyenas?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” the boy exclaimed gleefully. “Talk about a circus,
Fitz; <em>I</em> call it a menagerie. This is a free show; and you and I have
box seats.” Then thoughtfully, and with a little shiver, “And I’m
mighty glad we have—and right above the ring. I—”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a roar that seemed to shake the slender
fronds of the palm trees and rock the balloon. The lion was directly
beneath them, smelling over the ground where they had been. The
two small comrades cuddled close together upon the locker, held
each other’s hands, and strained their eyes and ears to see and hear
all that was going on. Presently the leopard, too, was among the
trees and, like the lion, was nosing from one spot to another; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the jackals and hyenas had ranged themselves along the border of the
little oasis, and were indulging in a discordant serenade.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” the boy grunted in disgust. “Those cowardly things out
there make me lonesome with their mournful sounds.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/drawing15.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Me, too,” the goblin admitted, nodding. Then he whispered
sharply: “There—there, Bob. The
lion’s going to the spring. See
him in that patch of moonlight?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And now he’s right at the
edge of the water. See him—see
him?”</p>

<p>“Uh—huh. And there’s the
leopard coming up on the
other side.”</p>

<p>The lion advanced majestically to
the edge of the pool. He looked askance at his slender cousin,
the leopard; and then he touched his nose to the clear water. Instantly
he sprang backward, bristling, sneezing and shaking his head,
in surprise and anger. The leopard looked on in wonder at her
cousin’s strange behavior; and the lion glared fiercely at her. The
two aëronauts hugged each other and laughed softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the lion essayed to slake his burning thirst at the glassy
pool; and again he retreated in rage and confusion. Attributing
his trouble to the leopard, evidently, he made a vicious slap at her
with his great paw. She sprang aside, spitting and snarling. The
lion pursued her; and, to escape, she sprang upon the slender trunk of
the palm tree to whose top the balloon was tied, and began a nimble
and quick ascent.</p>

<p>“Oo—h!” Bob gasped.</p>

<p>“Murder!” croaked Fitz Mee.</p>

<p>Then, instantly, he jumped from the locker; and opened and shut
the valve of the air-tank, three or four times in quick succession.</p>

<p>“Pst! pst! pst!” hissed the escaping air, and the leopard, more
alarmed at the unknown danger above than at the known danger below,
gave a yowl of fright and leaped to the ground and loped out of
sight.</p>

<p>Bob heaved a sigh of relief. “Fitz,” he whispered, “playing
with wild beasts is like playing with fire; a fellow’s likely to burn his
fingers.”</p>

<p>The goblin nodded; then he jerked out:</p>

<p>“But look at the lion! Bob, look at the lion!”</p>

<p>The noble animal was not content to go without a drink; and
once more he was drawing near the spring, cautiously, slowly. A
third time his nose and tongue touched the water; and a third time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sprang back, startled and enraged. And this time he rashly spatted
the surface of the pool with his paw, and let out a hoarse roar of futile
rage, as the treacherous liquid sent a stream of electricity tingling
through his anatomy.</p>

<p>The two aëronauts were hunkered upon the locker, leaning far
over the rim of the basket and laughing heartily but softly. On a
sudden the goblin’s hands slipped and he fell headlong from the car—turning
completely over in mid air and lighting plump astride the
lion’s back!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BALLOONISTS ENCOUNTER ARABS</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="165" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Fitz Mee let out a frantic yell as he descended;
Bob echoed it. “I’m a goner!” squeaked the goblin
as he alighted on the lion’s back.</p>

<p>“Goner!” screamed the boy, in unison.</p>

<p>The lion, no doubt coupling the sudden arrival
of the little green sprite with the unusual condition of the spring
he had always known, went mad with fright. He stuck his tail between
his hind legs, gave a snort, followed by a prolonged and doleful
whine, and scampered away among the trees and across the sands
of the desert, the goblin clinging to his mane.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear—dear!” moaned the boy. “What am I to do? What
<em>can</em> I do? Poor old Fitz Mee! Poor old Convulsions! The lion’ll
shake him off out there—and—and eat him up! And I can’t help
him! I don’t dare to go to his aid; the other beasts would eat <em>me</em>!
Was ever a boy in such a pickle! Oh, I wish I was back home! I
do—I do! I was a fool to come on such a wild adventurous trip,
anyhow! Poor old Fitz Mee! Poor old Epilepsy! Gone! Lost!
And here I am down here in the desert—with miles of trackless sands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
all around me; and with no means of getting away—except an old
balky balloon! Oh, dear—dear!”</p>

<p>He wrung his hands and wept. At last, however, he muttered
sleepily: “Poor unlucky old Fitz! He’s always getting into
trouble and danger; he’s always tumbling out of the balloon. I’ve
rescued him two or three times; but I can’t go on rescuing him every
few hours. He’ll have to look out for himself this time; I can’t do
anything for him. And,”—yawning,—“I’m so—so sleepy. I’ve just
got to—sleep; that’s all—all—there is—”</p>

<p>He sank upon the bottom of the car and lost all sense of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>“Bob! Oh, Bob!” Someone was calling him—someone in the
far distance, he thought.</p>

<p>“Huh!” ever so drowsily.</p>

<p>“Bob! Bob Taylor! Wake up!”</p>

<p>“Hel—hello!” the boy grunted.</p>

<p>“Here! Wake up, you lazy pest! Do you hear me? Ah-hah!
Do you <em>feel</em> me?”</p>

<p>“Ouch!”—petulantly—“Quit! Quit, I say!”</p>

<p>Someone was twitching and pinching the lad’s ear. He stirred,
opened his eyes, flounced over upon his stomach and raised his head.
There stood the Little Green Goblin of Goblinville, grinning down
at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fitz!” the boy cried, springing to his feet and holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee!”</p>

<p>The goblin continued to grin and bat his pop eyes—saucily, perversely.
Daylight was just breaking.</p>

<p>“When—when did you get back?” Bob inquired, embarrassed
by his comrade’s manner.</p>

<p>“Just got back, my friend,” Fitz croaked hoarsely; “and a time
I’ve had getting you awake. I called and called from the ground,
but you slept on. So I had to climb the tree; and then yell at you—and
yell again and again, and shake you, and pinch you. You must
have been greatly worried over my disappearance and danger! Oh,
yes! Sure! You couldn’t sleep at all, you were so worried!”</p>

<p>“Fitz, I <em>was</em> worried,” the boy replied sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Of course!” the goblin sneered. “That’s what I <em>said</em>—you
were so worried you couldn’t <em>sleep</em>!”</p>

<p>“You may say what you please,” Bob insisted, “but I was worried—worried
like everything. I thought I’d never see you again.”</p>

<p>“And no doubt you searched for me, seeking to rescue me from
my perilous position!” Fitz continued sarcastically. “Why, to be
sure you did! Oh, my!—yes, indeed!”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t hunt for you,” Bob returned thickly, a hint of tears
in his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“You didn’t?” snappishly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>why</em> didn’t you—huh?”</p>

<p>“How could I, Fitz, with wild beasts all
around me?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/drawing16.jpg" width="150" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Well,”—crustily,—“maybe there wasn’t
wild beasts all around me! Hey, Bob Taylor!”</p>

<p>“You’re unreasonable, Fitz!” angry now.
“Of course, you were in danger. But what
would have been the use of my rushing into
danger when I couldn’t help you a bit by doing
it? I couldn’t whip all those wild animals and
snatch you away from them. Now, could I?”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose you couldn’t,”—sullenly and
rather reluctantly admitting the truth. “But it
did make me <em>mad</em>, Bob, to find you sleeping so
comfortably and soundly after the terrible time
I’ve had.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a bad time, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, I rather <em>guess</em> I did!”</p>

<p>“How far did the lion carry you?”</p>

<p>“About a hundred miles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not that far!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know, smarty? <em>You</em> weren’t there!”</p>

<p>“Well—well! Maybe he did. But why didn’t you stop him
before he went so far?”</p>

<p>“Stop him! Bob Taylor, I just wish you’d have to take a ride on
a lion once! Stop him! I <em>did</em> try to. I yelled and yelled at him to
stop; but he just went the faster.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you let loose and roll off, then?”</p>

<p>“Just because I <em>couldn’t</em>—that’s why.”</p>

<p>“You <em>couldn’t</em>?”</p>

<p>“No, I <em>couldn’t</em>!” irritably.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why? Bob, you’re foolish! Just because he went so fast I
was afraid to let loose—afraid the fall might hurt me.”</p>

<p>Bob laughed.</p>

<p>“Laugh!” muttered Fitz, gritting his teeth. “You think you’re
smart!”</p>

<p>“But how did you get off? How did you get away from the
lion?” the boy suggested.</p>

<p>“He stumbled and fell—and threw me off.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t he try to eat you up, then?”</p>

<p>“Eat me up? No, he was dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“Why, what killed him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I didn’t stop to find out.”</p>

<p>“What do you <em>think</em> killed him?”</p>

<p>“I think he just ran himself to death.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz!”</p>

<p>“Or he was scared to death.”</p>

<p>“Take care!”</p>

<p>“Or died from heart disease.”</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee, you’re yarning to me; you’ve been yarning to me
about your adventure all the way through.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” Fitz cried, grinning impishly. “Wasn’t I on the
lion’s back the last you saw of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t he carrying me off across the sands?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t I come back alive—without a hurt or scratch?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you’ve no good reason to doubt my story. And,
Bob, I can tell you something else—something that <em>will</em> surprise you
and test your credulity.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did I get back here—from a hundred miles away, do you
suppose?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea.”</p>

<p>“I fell in with a caravan of Arabs, and they brought me.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where are the Arabs now?”</p>

<p>“Right out there. See ’em?”</p>

<p>Bob looked in the direction indicated. There, sure enough, was
a number of Arabs with horses and camels rapidly approaching the
oasis.</p>

<p>The boy turned to his companion and murmured reproachfully:
“Fitz, you’re a big story-teller—that’s what <em>you</em> are. Just now you
happened to see those Arabs, and you put them into your story.
You’ve been spinning a big yarn to me. I’ll bet the lion didn’t carry
you but a short distance out on the sands; then you came to your
senses, got over your surprise, and rolled off and made your way
back. I believe you’ve been here ever since shortly after I went to
sleep. Now, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee grinned broadly; but would make no reply to the
charge. Instead, he said:</p>

<p>“Bob, we’d better be getting away from here. Those Arabs have
been travelling all night, taking advantage of the cool air; and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they’ll spend the hot hours of the day under the trees of this oasis
near this spring.”</p>

<p>“My!” Bob ejaculated sharply.</p>

<p>“What?” his companion asked, in keen concern.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking about
the spring—about its being
charged with electricity.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled the
goblin. “I hadn’t
thought of that. We’d
better get away from
here before those Arabs
discover what we’ve done to
the spring, Bob. They’ll be
mad when they find out; and they
might shoot us with the long guns
they carry. Sh! There comes one
with a camel now.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/drawing17.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The two aëronauts kept perfectly quiet.
The Arab swiftly approached the spring, leading his
camel and hugging an empty waterskin to his breast. The beast of
burden tried to get at the tempting water, and its owner tried to keep
it back, scolding and jerking at the halter-rope. But the camel succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in touching the water with its nose; and immediately it surged
backward, coughing and shivering. The Arab, in an effort to control
the frightened animal, chanced to set his foot in the edge of the pool.
Then he gave a startled yell and danced about on one leg, grimacing
and grunting. The whole thing was so funny that Bob could not
restrain a snort of laughter. The Arab cast his gaze aloft. Then
he yelled louder than before, dropped the halter-rope, and sped
away to tell his companions of his wonderful experience and discovery.</p>

<p>“You’ve played the mischief, Bob!” Fitz Mee grumbled, but
grinning in spite of himself. “Untie that rope; let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p>The boy was prompt to obey. Fitz released the air; and
the balloon began to rise slowly, steadily, floating out over
the shining sands. At that moment, however, the whole band of
Arabs put in an appearance at the edge of the oasis; and, with shouts
and imprecations, raised their guns and fired at the rising air-ship.
The bullets whistled around the two adventurers, causing them to
drop precipitately to the bottom of the car.</p>

<p>“You hurt, Bob?” Fitz inquired.</p>

<p>“No. You?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Bully!”</p>

<p>“That’s what <em>I</em> say!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Fitz, that was a close shave.”</p>

<p>“Too close for comfort.”</p>

<p>“Look here! One bullet went through the basket.”</p>

<p>“Yes and look there! Another one went through the balloon-bag.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t do any harm, though—eh?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad they didn’t. And now I want to get out of this country;
I’m tired of it.”</p>

<p>“So am I. And I’ll set the needle north-east, for Goblinville;
and away we’ll go. Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” the boy echoed.</p>

<p>“Well—well!” the goblin mumbled irritably, fumbling at the
selector.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter <em>now</em>, Fitz?” Bob cried impatiently, stooping
to ascertain the cause of his companion’s exclamatory remark.</p>

<p>“The selector’s out of fix again, Bob. The needle won’t point
any way but south.”</p>

<p>“And—and, Fitz!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” springing erect.</p>

<p>“See how fast we’re going directly south.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodding gravely, “and there’s hardly any power at all
turned on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shut it all off, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“I will,” croaked the goblin. And he did so. Still the balloon
slowly drifted southward.</p>

<p>“What are we to do, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t know,” the little green fellow answered dejectedly.</p>

<p>“We’re going faster again.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to do some—” The boy broke off abruptly;
then cried in great excitement: “Look! Look, Fitz!”</p>

<p>“What?” screeched Fitz Mee, nervously dancing up and down.
“What? Where?”</p>

<p>“A mountain!” yelled Bob. “See it? Away to the south! A
big shiny mountain!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” moaned the goblin. “And that’s what’s drawing us!”
He cast a despairing look behind them.</p>

<p>“Why—why,” he jerked out, “Bob, the Arabs are following us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear—dear!” muttered the boy. “Now we <em>are</em> lost!”</p>

<p>“We don’t dare to stop,” Fitz whimpered; “the Arabs’ll get us!”</p>

<p>“And we don’t dare to go ahead,” Bob whined; “we’ll fly
against the side of that mountain and burst ourselves all to pieces!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” groaned the goblin.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” moaned the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bob!”</p>

<p>“What, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Which would you rather—be eaten up by the Arabs, or bursted
up by the mountain?”</p>

<p>“Why, <em>neither</em>, you silly old thing!” pettishly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to choose, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Well, we <em>haven’t!</em>”</p>

<p>“What else can we do, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I know!” brightly. “An idea has just come to me, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it, Bob?” joyfully.</p>

<p>“You’ll see—in time. Stop the balloon.”</p>

<p>“Bob, I <em>can’t</em> stop it!”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Well, pump up the tank and send the balloon to the
ground.”</p>

<p>“It’ll spill us out, Bob, at the rate we’re going.”</p>

<p>“Let it spill!”—recklessly.</p>

<p>“All right! Here goes!”</p>

<p>Fitz worked industriously at the pump; and the air-ship began to
drop swiftly. Soon it was within a few feet of the ground, flying
along rapidly.</p>

<p>“Hold on to the car when it strikes,” Bob cautioned his companion,
“or the balloon, relieved of our weight, will fly up—and
away from us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“I understand,” Fitz replied.</p>

<p>Bump! The car struck the earth, throwing its occupants sprawling;
but they hung on. Bump! Bump! Then it dragged along
the sand for some distance; and at last came to a stop.</p>

<p>“Pump the air-tank up good and tight, Fitz,” Bob commanded;
“we don’t want to lose our air-ship and be left out here in the desert.”</p>

<p>“But the Arabs’ll get us, anyhow,” Fitz complained disconsolately.
“There they come—only a few miles away!”</p>

<p>“Let ’em come!” the boy cried gleefully. “They’ll be sorry!
Let me have that hand-satchel.”</p>

<p>“But what’re you going to <em>do</em>, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Just wait and <em>see</em>!” was the tantalizing answer.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">A WIRELESS MESSAGE TO HEADQUARTERS</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t-2.jpg" width="175" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The goblin silently handed the small black
satchel to his comrade. The boy opened it
and took out two of the tiny bottles, remarking
as he did so:</p>

<p>“I—I rather hate to do it; but I’ve got
to—we’ve got to save ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But what do you mean to do, Bob?” his companion insisted.
“Tell me—before the Arabs get here.”</p>

<p>The boy silently shook a few tablets into his palm from each of
the two bottles. Then he queried:</p>

<p>“Fitz, does the—the effect of these tablets—these gob-tabs—last
forever? Tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>“The effect lasts as long as the person eats goblin diet, Bob.
That’s the reason I’ve insisted on your eating nothing else. See?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“Well, now what’re you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Going to give those Arabs some gob-tabs.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get them to take the gobs?” asked the little
green sprite, grinning broadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“You just watch me and see,” Bob
replied complacently; “and do whatever
I tell you to do.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/drawing18.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“All right. But you’ve got some
giant-tabs there, too. What are
you going to do with those?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see. Hist! Here
come the Arabs. Now,
don’t you hesitate to do
what I tell you, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, Bob.”</p>

<p>The Arabs, some on horses
and others on camels, came galloping
to the spot, raising a great
cloud of sand. They formed in
a circle round the two diminutive
aëronauts and their balloon;
and dismounted and stood
silently, sullenly scowling.</p>

<p>At last the sheik of the tribe
advanced and said:</p>

<p>“You two are devils. You’ve
poisoned the spring where we drink and refresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ourselves and our beasts. You must die; we’re going to kill you.”</p>

<p>Bob replied composedly: “Great sheik, we are magicians, not
devils. We worked enchantment upon the spring, but did not poison
it. As soon as the sun shines a few hours, the waters of the spring
will again be pure and sweet—purer and sweeter than ever before.
To convince you that we’re magicians, we’re ready to perform before
you. See! I will make a giant of my green comrade.”</p>

<p>The boy gave a giant-tab to the goblin and motioned him to
swallow it. Unhesitatingly Fitz obeyed; and almost immediately he
grew and swelled to gigantic size. With gestures and cries of amazement
the Arabs drew back. Several of them touched their foreheads
and muttered strange words; others prostrated themselves and
hid their faces upon their extended arms. But the fierce old sheik
gave no sign of wonder or fear. Instead, he said firmly, boldly:</p>

<p>“Devils can work magic upon devils; but devils cannot work
magic upon Allah’s elect. I’ll put you to the test; and if you fail,—as
you will!—you die. Give me and my children of your magic
medicine.”</p>

<p>At a word from their sheik, the Arabs formed a line. Then the
fierce old warrior of the desert said:</p>

<p>“My children, these devils cannot injure you with their magic
medicine. If they succeed in making giants of us, we shall then be
able to overcome all our enemies; if they fail, we shall be as we are—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the devils shall die.” Then to Bob: “Give us of your devil
drugs.”</p>

<p>The boy stepped forward and dropped a gob-tab into the outstretched
palm of each warrior. The sheik gave a signal; and twenty
red mouths flew open and twenty gob-tabs disappeared. At the same
moment Bob took a giant-tab. And a few minutes later two giants
stood triumphantly grinning down upon twenty bearded and turbaned
pygmies!</p>

<p>“Now, sheik,” Bob roared briskly and cheerily, “no doubt you’re
convinced that we’re what we claim to be—great magicians. But
we don’t mean to work you any injury, now that we’re big and you’re
small; although you meant to put us to death, just because <em>you</em> were
big and <em>we</em> were small. You’ll come back to your natural size all
right, in a few days. And we’re not going to rob you; just going to
borrow two of your camels.”</p>

<p>The sheik had stood silently staring at his diminutive warriors
and inspecting his own shrunken limbs. But now he piped shrilly:</p>

<p>“Allah is great! Allah is great! But what use can you have
for our camels? You are so huge that they cannot bear you!”</p>

<p>“Say!” Bob muttered in consternation. “Fitz, that’s a fact.
What are we to do? I meant to take two of the camels to carry us
and our balloon out of reach of the power of the magnetic mountain.
What are we to do?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus4">

<p class="caption">Two giants stood triumphantly grinning down upon twenty pygmies.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the goblin-giant grumbled surlily.</p>

<p>“Well, can’t you think of some plan?”</p>

<p>“You’re the one, Roberty-Boberty, that’s making the plans this
time.” And Fitz Mee grinned a grin that made his big fat face look
simply awful.</p>

<p>“I know,” Bob admitted ruefully. “But won’t you help a fellow
out, when he’s doing the best he can?”</p>

<p>“Say, Bob!”</p>

<p>“What?”—eagerly, expectantly.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what! We’ll have to take gob-tabs and go back to
goblin size. Then the camels can carry us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we couldn’t manage the camels—couldn’t get on ’em,
even,” the boy-giant objected. “Could we?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we couldn’t,” the goblin-giant admitted, shaking his
head. “I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” groaned Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” seconded Fitz.</p>

<p>“Say!” squeaked the old sheik, looking up at the two giants.
“What are we Arabs to do? We are so small we cannot mount and
manage our beasts.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” rumbled Bob.</p>

<p>“And <em>I</em> don’t know,” mumbled Fitz.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a nice pair of magicians—<em>you</em> are!” screeched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sheik, pulling at his long beard. “Don’t you know anything you can
do to help us out of our quandary?”</p>

<p>Each giant sadly shook his big head.</p>

<p>“Well,” the old sheik screeched, “I know what you’ve <em>got</em> to do—you’ve
got to give our beasts some of your magic medicine, and
shrink ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Bob ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Fitz exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” the boy-giant remarked.</p>

<p>“A splendid idea,” the goblin-giant agreed.</p>

<p>“And we can give giant-tabs to the two camels we’re going to
use,” Bob suggested.</p>

<p>“Of course we can,” Fitz assented.</p>

<p>“Well, here goes!”</p>

<p>The two giants went to work. After repeated trials they succeeded
in getting the camels and horses to swallow the magic medicine.
All those animals to whom they gave gob-tabs shrunk to pygmy
size; and the two camels to whom they administered giant-tabs
grew to giant size. Then the old sheik and his bearded warriors,
looking very dejected and forlorn, got upon their tiny beasts and rode
away over the sands.</p>

<p>Bob and Fitz lashed their balloon upon the back of one of the
giant camels, and mounted and set out toward the north. All that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
day they traveled and far into the night, the great desert animals covering
the ground rapidly. At last they stopped at an oasis; and there
rested until morning. Then they tested the selector of the balloon
and, to their unbounded delight, found it in perfect working order.
They had got beyond the influence of the magnetic mountain.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Bob, “we’ll take some gob-tabs and give some to the
camels; then we’ll be all ready to take to the air again.”</p>

<p>They carried out the plan thus expressed. When they were once
more ready to embark upon the tenuous tide of the air, Fitz Mee remarked:</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll telephone to Goblinland that we’re coming, that
we’ll arrive there to-morrow.” He drew forth his wireless telephone,
rang the tiny bell, and waited. Bob stood at his comrade’s
side, alertly observant. Presently he saw the goblin give a start and
heard him saying:</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello! Is this Goblinland? It is, you say? All
right. This is Fitz Mee. Yes, Fitz Mee. <em>Yes</em>, the Little Green
Goblin. Uh-huh. Well, give me the mayor’s office. Yes—<em>yes</em>!
the mayor’s office.”</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause; and then:</p>

<p>“Hello! Is this the mayor’s office in Goblinland? What?
Huh? Is this the mayor’s office in Goblinland, I say? You can’t
hear me? Well, I can’t hear <em>you</em>. I want to know if this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
mayor’s office in Goblinland. You say it is? Huh? Oh! All
right. Well, is the mayor there? How’s that? Well, I want to
speak to him, please.”</p>

<p>Another momentary pause; and then:</p>

<p>“Hello! <em>Hel</em>-lo, Hel-<em>lo</em>! Is this his honor, the mayor of Goblinland?
It is? How’s that? It <em>isn’t</em>? How’s that? What?
Huh?” Bob began to snicker. “Oh! All right. Well, mayor,
this is Fitz Mee. Fitz Mee, I say. No—<em>no</em>! Fitz Mee. <em>No!</em>
Not <em>Swiss cheese!</em>”—Bob laughed outright; and the goblin scowled
darkly. “F-i-t-z M-e-e, Fitz Mee. Oh! You understand now, do
you? Well, I’ve got the boy. Yes. Why, I’ve been delayed by
storms and misadventures. Yes. Yes, bad storms. We’ll get in
to-morrow morning, I think. Hey? I—I know; but I hope your
honor will pardon—what? Well, mayor, you don’t know what an
awful time I’ve had with this boy.” Bob rolled upon the ground
and roared. “Well, I’m very sorry. You’ll <em>what</em>—your honor?
Please don’t say <em>that</em>! Oh! <em>don’t</em> say that!” The goblin’s face had
gone white, Bob observed; and the boy wondered what was the matter.
“Yes, to—morrow morning. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee rang off, returned the instrument to his pocket, and
dropped upon the ground, pale and panting.</p>

<p>“What is it, what’s the matter, Fitz?” Bob inquired kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The goblin drew his knees up to his chin and rolled his pop
eyes and waggled his big head; but made no answer.</p>

<p>“What is it?” the boy repeated.</p>

<p>Fitz moaned, but made no other reply.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” Bob insisted.</p>

<p>The goblin shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t dare to, Bob,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I just don’t—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be off. I’m anxious to get
back home.”</p>

<p>“Back home?” springing nimbly to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Back <em>home</em>!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“But, Bob, you’re not going back
home.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/drawing19.jpg" width="200" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“But I am.”</p>

<p>“I say you’re <em>not</em>!”</p>

<p>“And I say I <em>am</em>!”</p>

<p>“Bob, you <em>can’t</em>!”</p>

<p>“Fitz, I <em>can</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“You <em>shan’t</em>!”</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em>!”</p>

<p>“You’re a spoiled, stubborn boy, Roberty-Boberty Taylor.”</p>

<p>“And you’re a contrary old goblin, Mr. Epilepsy Spasms Convulsions
Fitz Mee. Now!”</p>

<p>“Bob, you ought to be ashamed to call a comrade naughty
names.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em>; but you called me names first.”</p>

<p>“I know I did; and I’m sorry. But, Bob, why do you desire to
go back home?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m tired of being <em>away</em> from home; because I’m tired
of adventure.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t seen Goblinland yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care; I don’t want to see it, I—I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do. And you must go with me, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Why must I?”</p>

<p>“Because.”</p>

<p>“Well, because what?”</p>

<p>“I hate to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell me.”</p>

<p>“Because my head will come off, if you don’t.”</p>

<p>Bob started.</p>

<p>“Is that what the mayor told you?” he inquired. “Is that what
made you turn so pale?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The goblin nodded gravely; and said: “Yes, he said if I didn’t
have you in Goblinland by to-morrow forenoon, he’d have my head
cut off.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s a cruel old tyrant!” the boy cried hotly.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t,” the goblin protested; “he has to do what he said
he’d do. It’s the law, you know; the law that when one agrees to do
a certain thing by a certain time, he must do it or suffer death.”</p>

<p>“Well, such a fool law!” Bob muttered testily. “I don’t want
to go to a country that has such laws; and I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Bob, remember—if you don’t go with me, I’ll be killed.”</p>

<p>The boy was silent for some moments. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Well, Fitz, I’ll go with you—to save your life; but I wish I
hadn’t come with you at all.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were again off for Goblinland.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">ARRIVED IN GOBLINLAND</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a-2.jpg" width="155" height="165" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">All that day and all that night the two daring adventurers
traveled steadily and directly north-eastward,
and at the dawn of the next day they were
floating high over western China. The air was thin
and penetrating and both were shivering with cold.</p>

<p>Fitz Mee, standing upon the locker and watching the sunrise
through the binocular, observed:</p>

<p>“We’re almost to our journey’s end, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Almost to Goblinland?” the boy queried.</p>

<p>“Yes; I can see it.”</p>

<p>“Where—where?” Bob cried eagerly, mounting to his comrade’s
side.</p>

<p>“See that mountain top a little to the left yonder?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“Oo—h!” Bob muttered. “It must be a pretty cold place to
live.” And his teeth chattered sympathetically at the thought.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” the goblin assured him. “You see Goblinland is
really the crater of a volcano.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“The crater of a volcano?” said Bob, in mild consternation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Fitz laughed. “But you needn’t be alarmed, Bob; it’s
an extinct volcano. Still the crust over it is so thin that the ground
is always warm and the climate mild. Now we’re getting right over
the place. Release the selector and pump up the air-tank; and we’ll
soon cast anchor in port.”</p>

<p>As they slowly descended Bob swept his eyes here and there,
greedily taking in the scene. Goblinland was indeed the crater of
an immense ancient volcano. The great pit was several miles in diameter
and several hundred feet in depth, walled in by perpendicular
cliffs of shiny, black, volcanic rock. Through the middle of this
natural amphitheater ran a clear mountain brook; and on either side
of the stream, near the center of the plain, were the rows of tiny
stone houses constituting Goblinville. Shining white roadways
wound here and there, graceful little bridges spanned the brook, and
groves of green trees and beds of blooming flowers were everywhere.</p>

<p>“How beautiful!” Bob exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the goblin nodded, his eyes upon the village below, “to
me, at least; it’s my home.”</p>

<p>“I know now why you goblins always travel in balloons,” the
lad remarked; “you can’t get out of your country in any other way.”</p>

<p>Again Fitz Mee nodded absent-mindedly. Then he said:
“My people are out to welcome us, Bob. Look down there in the
public square.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy did as directed. “What a lot of ’em, Fitz!” he tittered
gleefully. “And what bright-colored clothes they wear—red and
green and blue and all colors!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Fitz Mee answered. Then, after a momentary pause:
“The mayor will be present to greet us, Bob. He’ll make a speech;
and you must be very polite and respectful. See them waving at
us—and hear them cheering!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the balloon had touched the earth and eager
hands had grasped the anchor-rope.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello, Fitz Mee! Welcome home, Fitz Mee!” were
the hearty greetings that arose on all sides.</p>

<p>Fitz Mee stepped to the ground, bowing and smiling, and Bob
silently followed his example. The balloon was dragged away and
the populace closed in upon the new arrivals, elbowing and jostling
one another and chuckling and cackling immoderately.</p>

<p>“Shake!” they cried. “Give us a wag of your paw, Fitz Mee!
Shake, Bob Taylor!”</p>

<p>There were goblins great and goblins small, goblins short and
goblins tall; goblins fat and goblins lean, goblins red and goblins
green; goblins young and goblins old, goblins timid, goblins bold;
goblins dark and goblins fair—goblins, goblins everywhere!</p>

<p>Bob was much amused at their cries and antics and just a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
frightened at their exuberant friendliness. Fitz Mee shook hands
with all comers, and chuckled and giggled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Out of the way!” blustered a hoarse voice. “Out of the way
for his honor, the mayor!”</p>

<p>A squad of rotund and husky
goblins, in blue police uniforms
and armed with maces, came forcing
in their way through the
packed crowd. Immediately behind
them was the mayor, a pursy,
wrinkled old fellow wearing a
long robe of purple velvet. The
officers cleared a space for him,
and he advanced and said pompously:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/drawing20.jpg" width="350" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Welcome,
Fitz Mee, known
the world over as
the Little Green
Goblin of Goblinville. I proclaim you the bravest, if not the speediest,
messenger and minister Goblinland has ever known. Again,
welcome home; and welcome to your friend and comrade, Master
Robert Taylor of Yankeeland. I trust that he will find his stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
among us pleasant, and that he will in no way cause us to regret that
we have made the experiment of admitting a human being—and a
boy at that!—to the sacred precincts of Goblinville. The freedom
of the country and the keys of the city shall be his. Once more, a
sincere and cordial welcome.”</p>

<p>Then to the officers: “Disperse the populace, and two of you
escort the Honorable Fitz Mee and his companion to their dwelling-place,
that they may seek the rest they greatly need after so arduous
a journey.”</p>

<p>The officers promptly and energetically carried out the orders
of their chief.</p>

<p>When Fitz and Bob were alone in the former’s house, the latter
remarked:</p>

<p>“Fitz, I believe I’ll like to live in Goblinville.”</p>

<p>“I—I hope you will, Bob,” was the rather disappointing reply.</p>

<p>“Hope I will? Don’t you think I will, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; boys are curious animals.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I will. You know you said I could do as I
pleased here.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Say, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“How does it come that you goblins speak my language?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“We speak any language—all languages.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, how do you learn so many?”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to learn ’em; we just know ’em naturally—as
we know everything else we know at all.”</p>

<p>“My, that’s great! You don’t have to go to school, not study,
nor anything, do you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was a goblin.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not,” laughed Fitz Mee; “and you never will be.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll be a man some day, and that will be better.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you will.”</p>

<p>“Maybe?”</p>

<p>“You’ll never be a man if you stay in Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“I won’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I ever grow any?”</p>

<p>“Not as long as you stay in Goblinland—and eat our kind of
food.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll get older, and then I’ll be a man, or a goblin, or
something—won’t I?”</p>

<p>“You’ll still be a boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pshaw!” Bob pouted. “I don’t like that. You told me I
could be what I pleased in Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” Fitz Mee returned quietly but firmly. “I told
you that in our country boys—meaning goblin boys, of course—were
compelled to do what pleased them and were not permitted to do
what pleased others. That law or custom is still in effect; and you,
as a human boy, will be subject to it.”</p>

<p>“And I can do anything that pleases me?”</p>

<p>“You can’t do anything else.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Bob shouted gleefully. “I guess I’ll like Goblinland
all right; and I don’t care if I do stay a boy. Am I the first human
boy that ever got into your country, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“You’re the first human being of any kind that ever set foot in
Goblinland.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, I’ll try not to make your people sorry you
brought me here, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bob,” his companion made reply, a little dejectedly,
the boy thought. “And what would you like to do first—now
that you are in a land that is absolutely new to you?”</p>

<p>“Fitz, I’d like to take a good long sleep.”</p>

<p>“That would please you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“More than anything else, for the present?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right. Off to bed you go. You’ll find a couch in the next
room. Go in there and tumble down.”</p>

<p>“I will pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“But you must go now.”</p>

<p>“Must go now? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s the law in Goblinland that a boy shall do what he
pleases—and at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t go to bed till I get ready, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to defy the law, do you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Doggone such an old law!” the lad muttered peevishly.</p>

<p>Fitz Mee giggled and held his sides and rocked to and fro.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter of you, anyhow?” Bob cried crossly.</p>

<p>His comrade continued to laugh, his knees drawn up to his chin,
his fat face convulsed.</p>

<p>“Old Giggle-box!” the boy stormed. “You think you’re smart—making
fun of me.”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee grew grave at once.</p>

<p>“Bob,” he said soberly, “you’ll get into trouble, and you’ll get
me into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“Go to bed at once, that’s a good boy.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the outer door opened and a uniformed officer stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>“His honor, the mayor, begs me to say,” he gravely announced,
“that as Master Robert Taylor has said that he would be pleased to
sleep, he must go to sleep—and at once. His
honor trusts that Master Taylor will respect
and obey the law of the land, without further
warning.”</p>

<p>The officer bowed and turned
and left the house.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!”
Bob gasped, completely
taken aback.
“What kind of a country is this, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Fitz
Mee tumbled
to the floor,
and rolled and roared.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/drawing21.jpg" width="400" height="375" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The ludicrousness of the situation appealed to the fun-loving
Bob, and he joined in his companion’s merriment. Together they
wallowed and kicked upon the floor, prodding each other in the ribs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and indulging in other rude antics indicative of their exuberant glee.</p>

<p>When they had their laugh out Bob remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go to bed, Fitz, just to obey the law; but I don’t
suppose I can snooze a bit.”</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations, however, the lad, really wearier
than he realized, soon fell asleep. He slept through the day and
far into the hours of darkness; and it was almost dawn of the next
day when he awoke. He quietly arose and began to inspect his surroundings.
A soft white radiance flooded the room. He drew aside
the window-blind and peeped out. Darkness reigned, but bright
lights twinkled here and there. He dropped the blind and again
turned his attention to the things within.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Fitz is awake,” he mumbled; “I’m hungry. I suppose
he slept on the couch in the next room. I wonder where all
this brightness comes from; I don’t see a lamp of any kind. Huh!
It comes from that funny little black thing on the stand there. What
kind of lamp can it be—hey?”</p>

<p>He walked over and looked at the strange object—a small perforated
cone, from the many holes of which the white light streamed.
Noticing a projecting button near the top of the black cone, he made
hold to touch it and give it a slight turn. Instantly the holes had
closed and the room was in darkness. He turned the button back
again; and the holes were open and the room was light as day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that beats <em>me</em>!” muttered Bob. “It looks like an electric
light; but I don’t see any wires. There aren’t any wires. I must
find Fitz and learn about this thing.”</p>

<p>He peeped into the adjoining room, which was in darkness, and
called:</p>

<p>“Fitz! Oh, Fitz! Are you asleep, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” was the startled reply. “Yes—no, I guess so—I guess
not, I mean.”</p>

<p>Bob laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, get up and come in here,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, it isn’t morning yet,” the goblin objected.</p>

<p>“I’ve had my sleep out, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, get up and come in here, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I might as well,” grumbled Fitz; “you won’t let me
sleep any more.”</p>

<p>Then, appearing in the doorway and rubbing his pop eyes and
blinking: “Now, what do you want?”</p>

<p>“First, I want to know what kind of a light this is,” indicating
the little black cone.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s an electric light, of course,” Fitz Mee made answer,
in a tone that showed his wonder and surprise that Bob should ask
such a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see how it can be, I don’t see any wires.”</p>

<p>“Wires?” chuckled Fitz. “We don’t need any wires.”</p>

<p>“Well, where does the electricity come from, then?”</p>

<p>“From the bug under the cone.”</p>

<p>“The bug?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the electric firefly. Didn’t you ever see one?”</p>

<p>Bob shook his head—half in negation, half in incredulity.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they’re peculiar to Goblinland, then,” Fitz went
on, grinning impishly. “We raise them here by thousands and use
them for lighting purposes. The electric firefly is a great bug.
Like the electric eel, it gives one a shock if he touches it; and like
the ordinary firefly, it sheds light—but electric light, and very bright.
I’ll show you.” He gingerly lifted the perforated cone.</p>

<p>There lay a bug, sure enough, a bug about the size of a hickory-nut,
and so scintillant, so bright, that the eye could hardly gaze
upon it.</p>

<p>“And this is the only kind of light you have in Goblinland,
Fitz?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. We light our houses, our streets, our factories, our mines,
everything with them.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” Bob exclaimed. “And what do you do for fire,
for heat?”</p>

<p>“We don’t need heat for our dwellings. Owing to the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
our country is protected from all cold winds by the high cliffs around
it, and that the earth crust is thin over the fires of the volcano below,
the temperature remains about eighty the year round. Then, we
don’t cook any crude, nasty food, as you humans do; so—”</p>

<p>“No, you live on pills,” Bob interjected, in a tone of scorn and
disgust. “Bah!”</p>

<p>“So,” Fitz Mee went on smoothly, unheeding his comrade’s
splenetic interruption, “all we need heat for is in running our factories.
For that we bore down to the internal fire of the earth.”</p>

<p>“Well—well!” Bob ejaculated. “You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, where are your factories, Fitz? I didn’t see anything
that looked like factories when we got out of the balloon.”</p>

<p>“They’re all in caverns hewed in the cliffs.”</p>

<p>“And the fire you use comes from ’way down in the ground?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you light your factories with electric fireflies?”</p>

<p>The goblin gravely nodded. Bob was thoughtfully silent for a
moment; then he remarked:</p>

<p>“It must be awfully hot work in your factories—the men shut
up in caves, and no fresh air.”</p>

<p>“We have plenty of fresh air in our works,” Fitz hastened to
make plain; “we have large funnel-shaped tubes running up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
mountain-tops. The cold wind pours down through them, and we
can turn it on or off at our pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Say!” Bob cried.</p>

<p>“What?” queried his companion.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go through your factories.”</p>

<p>“You mean what you say, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Mean what I say?” said Bob, in surprise bordering on indignation.
“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“That you’d like to go through our factories?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Why not?”</p>

<p>“When do you want to make the—the experiment—the effort?”</p>

<p>“To-day—right away, soon as we’ve had something to eat.”</p>

<p>“All right, Bob,”—with a smile and a shake of the head,—“but—”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. We’ll have breakfast and be off. It’s coming daylight,
and the factories will be running full blast in an hour from
now.”</p>

<p>“More pills for breakfast, I reckon,” Bob grumbled surlily.</p>

<p>“More tablets and pellets,” Fitz Mee grinned, rubbing his hands
together and rolling his pop eyes.</p>

<p>“Huh!” the boy grunted ungraciously. “I wish you folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cooked and ate food like civilized people. I’m getting tired of nothing
but pills. I can’t stand it very long—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get used to it,” the goblin said, consolingly.</p>

<p>“Used to it!” the boy snorted angrily. “Yes, I’ll get used to it
like the old man’s cow got used to living on sawdust; about the time
she was getting used to it she died.” But he accepted the pellets
and tablets his companion offered him, and meekly swallowed them.
Then they caught up their caps and left the house.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Bob and his comrade went straight to the mayor’s
office; and to that august official Fitz Mee
said:</p>

<p>“Your honor, Master Taylor wishes to go
through our factories.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard,” the mayor answered
grimly, “but could hardly credit my ears.” Then to Bob: “Master
Taylor, is this true that I hear: that you desire to go through
our factories?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Bob replied respectfully but sturdily, rather wondering,
however, why such an ado should be made over so small a
matter.</p>

<p>“Very well, Fitz Mee,” said the mayor to that worthy, “I’ll
depend upon you to see that Master Taylor goes through our factories;
and I’ll hold you responsible for any trouble that may arise.
Here’s your permit.”</p>

<p>When the two were out of the mayor’s presence and on their
way to the factories, Bob remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fitz, how did the mayor learn that I want to go through your
machine-shops and places?”</p>

<p>“He heard us talking.”</p>

<p>“Heard us talking?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s a wireless telephone instrument in the room
where we were, an automatic one that catches every sound.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And what did the mayor mean by saying he’d hold you responsible
for any trouble that might arise?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing—nothing!” Fitz Mee answered hastily and
grumpily.</p>

<p>The boy questioned his companion no further, and soon they
crossed one of the picturesque bridges spanning the brook, ascended
a long, gentle slope to the base of the black cliffs, and stood before
a wide, nail-studded door. To the officers on guard Fitz Mee presented
the mayor’s permit. The guard deliberately and carefully
read the slip of paper, then he lifted his brows, drew down the corners
of his mouth and grunted pompously:</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee, you’re aware of the import of this official document,
are you?”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee nodded gravely, grimly, and Bob looked from one to
the other in silent wonder.</p>

<p>The guard went on: “This permit of his honor, the mayor,

of the honorable Fitz Mee, hereby permitted to go through our factories,
but by the same token is <em>compelled</em> to go through

it, Fitz Mee?”</p>

<img src="images/drawing22.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“It’s all right,” Fitz Mee muttered sullenly, but
determinedly.</p>

<p>“Pass in,” said the officer, unbolting
the door and dragging it open.</p>

<p>As soon as the two had stepped
over the sill, the door was slammed
shut behind them, and Bob heard the great
bolts shot into place—and shuddered in
spite of himself. On each side of him
were smooth, solid walls of rock: ahead of
him stretched a dusky corridor dimly lighted
with electric fireflies suspended here and
there. The dull rumble of distant machinery
came to his ears; the faint smell of smoke and sulphurous fumes
greeted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fitz?” the lad said to his comrade, who stood silent at his side.</p>

<p>The goblin simply gave the speaker a look in reply.</p>

<p>“Fitz,” Bob continued, “what’s the meaning of all this talk
about my going through the factories? What’s the matter, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing!” Fitz murmured hoarsely, shiftily gazing
here and there.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” the boy insisted. “Why do you all emphasize
the word ‘through’?”</p>

<p>“Why—why,” Fitz stammered, rubbing his nose and blinking
his pop eyes, “we thought maybe you didn’t mean that you desired to
go <em>through</em> the factories; thought maybe you meant you desired to go
<em>partly</em> through only—just wanted to see <em>some</em> of the things.”</p>

<p>“No,” Bob hastily made reply, “I want to go through; I want
to see everything. Understand?”</p>

<p>Fitz nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, come on, then,” he said; “we’ve got to be moving.”</p>

<p>As they went along the corridor, Bob became aware of doors
ahead opening to right and left. He saw the flash of flames and
heard the whirr of wheels and the hub-bub of hammers.</p>

<p>“This room to the right,” said Fitz Mee, “is the machine-shop;
that on the left is the forging-room.”</p>

<p>They visited each in turn, and the lad was delighted with all he
saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“He! he!” he laughed when they were again out in the corridor
and free from the thunder and crash and din that had almost deafened
them. “The idea, Fitz, of me not wanting to go through your factories;
of not wanting to see everything! You bet I want to go
through! You thought I’d be afraid—that’s what <em>you</em> thought; and
the mayor, too. But I’ll show you; I’m no baby—not much!”</p>

<p>His companion grinned impishly, but made no reply.</p>

<p>The next place they entered was the great moulding-room.
Open cupolas were pouring forth white-hot streams of molten metal,
which half-nude and sweaty, grimy goblins were catching in ladles
and bearing here and there. The temperature of the room was almost
unbearable; the atmosphere was poisonous with sulphurous
gases. Bob crossed the threshold and stopped.</p>

<p>“Come on,” commanded his companion; “we must hurry along,
or we won’t get through to-day.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe I care to go through here,” Bob said hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Why?” Fitz Mee jerked out.</p>

<p>“It’s so awful hot and smelly,” the boy explained; “and I’m—I’m
a little afraid of all that hot metal.”</p>

<p>“No matter; you must go through here.”</p>

<p>“I <em>must</em>?” Bob cried indignantly.</p>

<p>“Certainly. You said you’d be pleased to go through our factories;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
so now you must go through—through every apartment.
Boys in Goblinville, you know, must do what pleases ’em.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t please me to go through this fiery furnace, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys’re not allowed to change their minds every few
minutes in Goblinville. Come on.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” Bob said obstinately.</p>

<p>“You’ll get into trouble, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll get <em>me</em> into trouble.”</p>

<p>“You into trouble? How?”</p>

<p>“You heard what the mayor said, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go through for your sake, Fitz; but I don’t want to.
It is a fool law or custom—or whatever it is—that won’t let a fellow
change his mind once in a while, when he feels like it! A great
way that is to let a boy do what he pleases! But lead on.”</p>

<p>They sauntered through the moulding—room, Bob trembling and
dodging and blinking, and out into the corridor again.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” the urchin exclaimed, inhaling a deep breath of relief.
“I don’t want any more of that! I’m all in a sweat and a
tremble; I was afraid all the time some of that hot metal would splash
on me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“It does splash on the workers at times,” Fitz Mee observed
quietly.</p>

<p>Not heeding his companion’s remark, Bob continued: “And
my lungs feel all stuffy. I couldn’t stand such a hot and smelly place
more than a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose the moulders stand it for ten hours a
day?” Fitz asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they do—and I don’t see <em>why</em> they do,” the boy
replied.</p>

<p>“You don’t see why they do?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“For the same reason workmen stand disagreeable and dangerous
kinds of work in your country, Bob; to earn a living.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do it,” the boy declared loftily.</p>

<p>“You might have to, were you a grown man or goblin.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t. My papa doesn’t have to do anything of the
kind.”</p>

<p>“Your father’s a physician, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, doesn’t he miss meals, and lose sleep, and worry over
his patients, and work sometimes for weeks at a time without rest
or peace of mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you’d rather do that than be a common laborer for eight
or ten hours a day, would you?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know; I’d rather just be a boy and have fun all the
time. And I guess I’ve seen enough of your factories, Fitz; I want
to get out into the fresh air and sunshine again.”</p>

<p>“You must go on through,” the goblin answered, quietly but
positively.</p>

<p>“Well, have we seen nearly all there is to see?”</p>

<p>“No, we’ve just begun; we haven’t seen one-tenth part yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” Bob groaned. “I never can stand it, Fitz; it’ll take
us all day.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the goblin nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I tell you I can’t stand it.”</p>

<p>“But you must; it was your choice.”</p>

<p>“Choice!” angrily. “I didn’t know What it would be like.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have chosen so rashly. Come on.”</p>

<p>Bob demurred and pleaded, and whimpered a little, it must be
confessed; but his guide was inexorable.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enter into details in regard to all the boy
saw, experienced and learned. Let it suffice to say that at three
o’clock that afternoon he was completely worn out with strenuous
sight-seeing. The grating, rumbling, thundering sounds had made
his head ache; the sights and smells had made his heart sick. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
had seen goblins, goblins, goblins—goblins sooty and grimed, goblins
wizened and old before their time; goblins grinding out their lives
in the cutlery factory; goblins inhaling poisonous fumes in the chemical
works; goblins, like beasts of burden, staggering under heavy
loads; goblins doing this thing, that thing and the other thing, that
played havoc with their health and shortened their lives. And he
was disgusted—nauseated with it all!</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz!” he groaned. “I can’t go another step; I can’t stand
it to see any more! I thought it would be pleasant; but—oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Sit down here and rest a minute,” Fitz Mee said, not unkindly,
indicating a rough bench against the wall of the corridor. “Now,
why can’t you bear to see any more?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s so awful!” the boy moaned. “I can’t bear to see ’em
toiling and suffering, to see ’em so dirty and wretched.”</p>

<p>The goblin laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Bob, you’re a precious donkey!” he cried. “True, the workers
in the factories toil hard at dirty work—work that shortens their
lives in some cases; but they’re inured to it, and they don’t mind it
as much as you think. And what would you? All labor is hard, if
one but thinks so; there are no soft snaps, if one does his duty. It’s
the way of the goblin world, and it’s the way of the human world.
All must labor, all must suffer more or less; there’s no escape for
the highest or the lowest. And work has its compensation, has its
reward; it—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” the lad muttered petulantly. “I don’t want to
hear any more. You talk just like my papa does. I wish I’d never
been born, if I’ve got to grow up and work. So there!”</p>

<p>“You’ll never grow up, if you stay in Goblinville, Bob,” Fitz
Mee said softly; but his pop eyes were twinkling humorously.
“And you won’t have to work—not much, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Bob sat soberly silent; evidently he was doing some deep thinking.</p>

<p>The goblin went on: “If you’re rested now, we’ll resume our
sight-seeing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see any more,” the lad grunted pugnaciously;
“and I’m not going to, either.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come on.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Please do, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, I say.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get us both into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I do.”</p>

<p>“They’ll send us to prison.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“They will.”</p>

<p>“Who will?”</p>

<p>“The mayor and his officers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Send us both?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” bristling, “I guess they won’t send <em>me</em>—the old meddlers!
They won’t dare to; I’m not a citizen of this country.”</p>

<p>“That won’t make any difference, Bob!”</p>

<p>“It will too. If they send me to prison, the people of my country
will come over here and—and lick ’em out of their boots. Now!”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee bent double and stamped about the floor, laughing till
the tears ran down his fat cheeks. But suddenly he sobered and said:</p>

<p>“Come on, Bob; you’ve got to.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” the boy declared perversely. “I <em>don’t</em> have to.”</p>

<p>The goblin made no further plea; but placing a silver whistle
to his lips blew a sharp blast. In answer, a squad of officers stepped
from the shadows.</p>

<p>“What’s wanted, Fitz Mee?” said the leader.</p>

<p>“This boy flatly refuses to obey the law, to go on through the
factories, as he stated would please him.”</p>

<p>“Boy, is this true?” demanded the officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” Bob confessed fearlessly, shamelessly.</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee, he confesses,” muttered the officer. “What would
you have me do?”</p>

<p>“Take him and carry him through,” Fitz Mee said icily.</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the officer. “But if we do that we take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the case out of your hands, Fitz Mee. And in order to make a satisfactory
report to the mayor, we’ll have to carry him through all the
factories—those he has already visited as well as those he has not.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/drawing23.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Yes, that’s true,” Fitz nodded.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Bob cried, keenly concerned.</p>

<p>The officer gravely repeated his statement.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” the boy exclaimed. “You
fellows go away and quit bothering me. I
never saw such a country! A fine place for
a boy to do as he pleases, surely! Come on,
Fitz.”</p>

<p>All the goblins laughed heartily, and Bob
disrespectfully made faces at them, to their
increased amusement.</p>

<p>When the two comrades had made their
round of the factories, and were out in the
fresh air again, the boy murmured meekly,
a sob in his throat:</p>

<p>“Fitz, I’m tired—I’m sick of it all! I wish I
hadn’t come here, I—I wish I was back home again.”</p>

<p>“What!” his companion cried in assumed surprise.</p>

<p>“I do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Back home, and be compelled to obey your elders—your parents
and your teachers?” Fitz Mee said, grinning and winking impishly.</p>

<p>“Well,”—pettishly,—“it wouldn’t be any worse than being compelled
to obey a lot of fool officers, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You’re just compelled to do what pleases you, just as I told
you,” Fitz Mee explained smoothly.</p>

<p>“Oh, do shut up!” the lad pouted.</p>

<p>“You’re out of sorts,” the goblin giggled; “you’re hungry—you
need some food tablets.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” Bob gagged. “Pills! I can’t swallow any more of ’em—I
just can’t! Oh, I wish I had a good supper like mother cooks!”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee threw himself prone and kicked and pounded the
earth, laughing and whooping boisterously; and Bob stood and
stared at him, in silent disapproval and disgust.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">BEFORE THE MAYOR OF GOBLINLAND</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a-3.jpg" width="180" height="155" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">As the days passed Bob became more and more
disgruntled, more and more dissatisfied with
things in Goblinville. The bare thought of
food-tablets and drink-pellets disgusted and
nauseated him; and he could hardly swallow
them at all. The young goblins would not, could not, play the games
he liked to play. They were too small for one reason; and, then,
as it did not please them to do so, they were not permitted to do so.
And the boy was without youthful companionship. The only associates
he had were his faithful companion Fitz Mee and the officers
of the town, who were always at his elbow to see that he did what
pleased him. This constant espionage became simply unbearable;
and the lad grew peevish, gloomy; desperate. At last he broke
down and tearfully confessed to his comrade:</p>

<p>“Fitz, I want to go back home; I do—I do! I can’t stand it here
any longer. It isn’t at all what I thought it would be like; and I’m
homesick!”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee did not laugh; he did not smile, even. On the contrary
he looked very grave—and a little sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“So you’re homesick, Bob—eh?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“And you desire to go home?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like things here in Goblinville?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“What is it you object to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, everything!”</p>

<p>“But especially?”</p>

<p>“Well, the—the pills, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” joyfully. “Is that all, Bob? We can fix that all right.
I’ll get a special permit from the mayor—he’s a political friend of
mine,—to let me prepare you food like you’ve been accustomed to.
Then you’ll be as happy as a clam, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t hardly know, Fitz; no, I don’t think I will.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Uk-uh.”</p>

<p>“Well, what else is wrong, then?”</p>

<p>The goblin’s pop eyes were dancing with mischief.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to be compelled to do what pleases me,” Bob confessed
shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” laughed Fitz Mee.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can laugh!” the boy cried, in weak irritation. “But
I don’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“You said it would just suit you, Bob—before you came here,”
Fitz chuckled hoarsely, holding his sides and rocking to and fro.</p>

<p>“I know I did; but I’d never tried it.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t like it?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” Bob answered very earnestly.</p>

<p>“And you’re homesick, and want to go home?”</p>

<p>The boy nodded, his eyes downcast.</p>

<p>“All the goblins’ll laugh at you, if you go to leave Goblinville.”</p>

<p>“Well, let ’em; I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“And your people and your schoolmates will laugh at you, when
you return home.”</p>

<p>Bob was silent, deeply pondering.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care?” Fitz Mee asked, cackling explosively.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do! But I’ve got to go, anyhow; I’ll die here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t, Bob,” said the goblin, teasingly.</p>

<p>“I will, too,” said Bob, desperately in earnest; “I know.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go to school, if you return home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that; I’ll have other boys to play with, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’ll have to obey the teacher.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll have to do what pleases your parents.”</p>

<p>“I know that, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you won’t be permitted to do what pleases yourself.”</p>

<p>“I know; I’ve thought it all over, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“And yet you wish to return home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>Fitz Mee laughed gleefully, uproariously, irrationally, laughed
till the tears coursed down his cheeks and his fat features were all
a-quiver.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” he gasped at last. “Roberty-Boberty, you’re not the
same boy you were, not at all; you’re not half as high and mighty.
What’s come over you, hey?”</p>

<p>“I’ve—I’ve learned something, I—I guess, Fitz.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have!”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to say,” replied Bob, grinning sheepishly; “but
I think I know what you brought me to Goblinland for.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“W-e-ll, to—to teach me what I’ve learned. Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to say,” mimicked the goblin.</p>

<p>Then both tittered.</p>

<p>“And you’re bound to go back home, Bob?” Fitz pursued.</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus6">

<p class="caption">“If you’re rested now, we’ll resume our sight-seeing.” (<a href="#Page_168">See page 168.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a pretty looking thing to go back to Yankeeland—a little
mite of a human like you!” sneeringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz!” the lad wailed. “Can’t I be made a real boy
again?”</p>

<p>The goblin impressively shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said slowly. “You see you’ve taken so many
gob-tabs it’s very doubtful whether you can be changed back into a
boy at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz, don’t say that!”—greatly distressed.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you were put on human diet for a long time, you
might come out all right,”—reflectively.</p>

<p>“But can’t I take something that will change me quick—right
away?”</p>

<p>Again the goblin shook his head.</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” he murmured. “Giant-tabs would make a giant
of you; and you don’t want to be a giant.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess, then, if you want to go back home right away,
you’ll have to go just as you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz!” almost blubbering. “I don’t want to go back home
this way; I just can’t! Can’t you give me something that will—will
stretch me and swell me to boy size—just to boy size? Can’t
you—can’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,”—with a gloomy shake of the head; “I never
heard of such a drug or chemical, but it’s barely possible our chemists
may know of something of the kind. I’ll see about it. But here’s a
difficulty.”</p>

<p>“What? What, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“Why, as you know, there’s no means of getting out of Goblinland
except by balloon; and I doubt if my balloon will carry you at
full and normal weight.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you get a bigger one?”</p>

<p>“I might have one made; I don’t—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—no, Fitz!” the boy interrupted frantically. “Don’t
think of doing that; I can’t wait. Can’t you borrow a bigger one?”</p>

<p>“There are no bigger ones, except the mayor’s state balloon.
It has two feather beds lashed together for a bag, and a very large
car.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you get it—can’t you get it, Fitz?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, indeed. Then, here’s another difficulty, Bob,
and a greater one to my mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fitz!” the boy moaned, wringing his hands. “You don’t
mean it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said the goblin, nodding gravely; but his twinkling
pop eyes belied his words. “You see, Bob, you’re the first human
being that has ever come to Goblinland. Now, the secrets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
country—including the secret of its whereabouts, have always been
carefully guarded. I don’t know what his honor, the mayor, will
say about letting you go.”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell anything, Fitz, I won’t—I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Not a thing?” questioned Fitz Mee.</p>

<p>“No, sir—not a thing.”</p>

<p>“W-e-ll, I—I don’t know. What will you do, Bob, if the mayor
won’t let you go back home?”</p>

<p>“I’ll just die—that’s what!”</p>

<p>The goblin slapped his thin thighs and laughed and whooped,
and laughed some more.</p>

<p>Out of patience, the lad screamed: “Laugh! Laugh till you
burst, you old Convulsions! You old Spasms! You old Hysterics!
Yeah! Yeah!”</p>

<p>And Fitz Mee did laugh—till he was entirely out of breath and
panting and wheezing like a bellows. When at last he had regained
control of himself, he whispered brokenly:</p>

<p>“Bob, we’ll—we’ll go and see—the mayor.”</p>

<p>And they caught up their caps and were off.</p>

<p>“So you wish to go home, boy—eh?” said the mayor, the august
ruler of Goblinville and all adjacent territory, as soon as the
two were ushered into his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Bob answered humbly. Then, with boyish inquisitiveness:
“But how did you know it?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” was the gruff reply. “It will please you to return
home will it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, indeed it will.”</p>

<p>“Then you must go. Be off at once.”</p>

<p>“But—but—” Bob began.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix all that,” his honor interrupted, quickly divining what
the boy meant to say. “I’m as anxious to be rid of you as you are
to be gone. You’ve stirred up a pretty rumpus here—<em>you</em> have.
You’re the first human boy that ever came into my domain; and you’ll
be the last. But I trust your experience has done you good—eh?”</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Sign this pledge that you won’t reveal what
you’ve seen and learned, and that you’ll take the lesson to heart.”</p>

<p>Bob gladly signed the pledge.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the mayor, his eyes snapping humorously,
“these are the conditions under which you must leave my domain:
I’ll call in the chemists and have them restore you to normal size;
I’ve already communicated with them, and they assure me they
can do it. Then I’ll let the honorable and worthy Fitz Mee take my
state balloon and carry you back to Yankeeland. You will set out
this afternoon at one o’clock. But one other thing I exact: you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
must bear nothing away with you that you did not bring here with
you.” And the mayor gave the boy a keen, meaningful look that
the urchin could not interpret.</p>

<p>The chemists came in, three aged and bewhiskered
goblins wearing long, black robes and
silk skull caps.</p>

<p>“My good chemists,” said the mayor,
“are you ready for the experiment?”</p>

<p>“All ready, your honor,” the eldest
of the three made answer, bowing
profoundly.</p>

<p>“To work, then,” the mayor
commanded.</p>

<p>The younger two advanced
and caught
and held Bob’s hands,
their fingers upon his
pulse. The eldest produced a tiny phial of thick, opalescent liquid.</p>

<p>“Put out your tongue,” he said to the boy.</p>

<p>The lad unhesitatingly obeyed, and the aged and trembling
chemist let a drop of the viscid liquid fall upon the tip of the youngster’s
quivering organ of speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous and startling, if not marvelous.
Bob let out a mad bellow of pain, shaking his head and writhing and
drooling. The mayor changed countenance and deprecatingly
shook his head. Fitz Mee groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“Draw in your tongue and shut your mouth and swallow!” the
three savants simultaneously yelled at the boy.</p>

<p>Bob reluctantly did as he was told; and immediately, instantaneously
he was restored to normal size.</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” shouted the chemists, embracing one another and
indulging in mad capers and other manifestations of insane joy. “A
success! A complete success!”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” murmured Fitz Mee. “A success!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the mayor muttered drily, grimly, “a remarkable success—a
<em>too</em> remarkable success! My good chemists, destroy what
you have left of that stuff, and make no more at your peril. I’m not
going to have any more <em>boys</em> manufactured in this country—a noisy,
disturbing lot! You hear me!” Then to Fitz Mee: “You take
your departure from the public square at one o’clock, remember.
The state balloon will be there in readiness. You’re excused.”</p>

<p>When the two comrades were again at Fitz Mee’s residence,
Bob remarked ingenuously:</p>

<p>“Fitz, while you’re getting ready I’m going to gather up some
of the gold nuggets I saw on the shore of the brook.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better not,” Fitz replied, without looking up from his work.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, if I were you—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, why?”</p>

<p>“They’re not yours.”</p>

<p>“I know. But you goblins make no use of them; and it wouldn’t
be wrong—wouldn’t be stealing, would it?”</p>

<p>“No,” Fitz Mee mumbled, “it wouldn’t be robbery, exactly.
But you heard what the mayor said.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“That you weren’t to take anything away with you that you
didn’t bring here with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard him. Is that what he meant?”</p>

<p>“To be sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, why does he object to my taking a few old nuggets of
gold that none of you will use?” said Bob peevishly.</p>

<p>“For this reason, Bob: you take that gold back to Yankeeland,
and tell where you got it—”</p>

<p>“But I won’t tell where I got it,” the lad interrupted.</p>

<p>Unheeding, the goblin continued: “And your money-mad people
will search out our country and conquer and ruin us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, Fitz!”</p>

<p>“What I say is true, Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>But Bob was neither convinced nor satisfied, and he resolved
to have the nuggets at all hazard. Where was the harm? The
gold was of no value to the goblins; it would be of great value to
him. And he wouldn’t say a word about where he got it—indeed
he wouldn’t. He would take it; and no one would be the wiser or
the poorer. So, while his comrade was busy at other things, he
slipped out to the brookside and filled his pockets.</p>

<p>One o’clock came, the time of departure, and all Goblinville,
including the mayor and his officers, was out to see the aëronauts
off upon their long voyage. The mayor shook hands with the two
and wished them God-speed and the populace gave them three hearty
cheers.</p>

<p>Then the anchor was weighed, and they were off. Slowly and
majestically the great state balloon began to ascend. But when it
had risen a hundred feet, Bob, looking over the side of the car, became
aware of a disturbance in the crowd beneath. He saw goblins
excitedly running this way and that and a number of officers trundling
a big black object on wheels across the public square.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of the rumpus, Fitz?” the lad cried to his
companion. “What’s that the officers have?”</p>

<p>“Why,” Fitz gasped, taking a hurried look beneath, “the officers
are running out the dynamite gun!”</p>

<p>“And they’re training it upon our balloon—upon <em>us</em>!” Bob whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hoarsely, his soul a prey to guilty fear. “What—what can it
mean, Fitz?”</p>

<p>Then arose the voice of the mayor, bellowing:</p>

<p>“Fitz Mee, descend! Come back! That boy can’t leave Goblinland
with his pockets full of gold! He has deceived us; he can’t
leave Goblinland at all. Come down; or we’ll send a dynamite shell
through the balloon-bag, and bring you down in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Fitz gave a few strokes to the pump, and the big balloon came
to a stop. Bob sat silent, speechless at the dread result of his rash act.</p>

<p>“You’ve played the mischief—<em>you</em> have, Bob Taylor!” his companion
snarled angrily, reproachfully. “And you’ll spend the balance
of your days in Goblinland—that’s what!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” the boy found voice to moan. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” Fitz called over the side of the car. “Hello, your
honor!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” answered the mayor.</p>

<p>“If I’ll make the boy throw the gold down to you, will that satisfy
you?”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t!” came the hoarse and determined reply. “Bring
the young scamp back! He shall stay in Goblinville!”</p>

<p>“I guess I won’t!” Bob shouted, desperation spurring his courage.
And he sprang to the air-tank and opened the cock. The balloon
began to rise swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Bob—Bob!” Fitz Mee groaned. “What have you done?
We’ll both be killed!”</p>

<p>“Boom!” went the dynamite gun; and a shell tore through the
balloon-bag, rending it asunder and sending goose feathers fluttering
in all directions.</p>

<p>The car began to drop like a plummet. Its occupants let
it out shrill screeches of terror. Then came the proverbial dull,
sickening thud! Bob felt the empty balloon—bag fall over him
and envelop him; and then he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>“Bob, crawl out of there.”</p>

<p>“Fitz! Fitz!” the boy cried, disentangling himself and struggling
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Fits!” laughed a big manly voice. “Yes, I guess you’ve got
’em, Bob; and you’ve rolled out of bed in one, and dragged the covers
with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob blinked and rubbed his sleepy eyes. There stood his father
in the doorway, grinning broadly;</p>

<p>“Hustle into your clothes, laddie,” he said; “breakfast’s ready.”</p>
